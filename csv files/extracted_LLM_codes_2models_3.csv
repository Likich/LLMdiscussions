"I hope a psych evaluation isn't done.
I want these people thrown in prison forever -not have some defense lawyer claim that something is wrong with the parents, who then escape justice because of some condition that suddenly pops up with a psychiatric test. These people knew better regardless of what some mental test says, and I don't care what anyone else says.
Guarantee you they knew, which is why they went to such lengths to keep it a secret.
These people should be thrown in a pit and left to fend in the same manner as their daughters, but forever.",Demand for Punishment and Accountability,Punitive Justice Over Sympathy,"**Advocacy for Punitive Justice, Rejection of Mitigating Factors**","- Insistence on Strict Accountability

"I am appalled that these people are getting a misdemeanor! These people should be locked up and the key thrown away! Can you imagine working next to the husband or wife and all the while they think this is ok??? These people are the type that grab little kids and put them out in the shed and they grow up and run away like that Jessica girl. These are sick sick people. These individuals need to be locked up for good. I'm tempted to show up on the 16th just to stare them down. Just think, mothers and fathers, if this really gets a misdemeanor, there is no jail time or very minimal at that. It's a fine (maybe) and a slap on the hand. Nothing under a ""misdemeanor"" has any ability to attempt to correct a mental problem such as this. These people need API and major, major jail time for severe child neglect and abuse.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.
Does that offend you?  Is it potentially uncomfortable or unsafe to the vast majority?  Can I legally do it?  No!  What is the difference?

"when I first heard trump would be here, I immediately thought how can I thumb my nose at him.  I want to show him no respect, I think he is evil (entitled to my opinion) and that he as president is a most ridiculous and dangerous proposition.
  and then I realize  - he feeds off that energy...it is fuel to his vile rants..it is an excuse to insult any sub-group of our citizenry that aren't rich old greedy white men like him. to his supporters, he's already demonstrated his dislike for at least 50% of his supporters.. these tough poor working women who support him...if he is willing to slur ver accomplished women, how do you think he's gonna regard you?  unless you're eastern European and about 20 yrs old...won't be pretty.
 so I decided the best thing I can do is not go, not feed his rhetoric, not give him a target to rant at, not let him rile the people.  what if nobody went to protest?  would that not take the wind out of his sails?  what would he say?

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

The code also implies a connection between acknowledging and accepting one's innate gender identity and mental health outcomes, highlighting the potential negative consequences of suppressing or denying one's true self.

"a 45-year-old male student, who dresses as a woman and goes by the name Colleen Francis, undressed and exposed his genitals on several occasions inside the woman’s locker room at Evergreen State College.

Students from nearby Olympia High School as well as children at a local swimming club share locker rooms with the college.

According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.

The coach later apologized when she discovered the man was transgendered but explained there were girls using the facility as young as six years old who weren’t used to seeing male genitals.",Comment: Inappropriate exposure in shared locker room by transgender individual.,Exposure vs. Inclusion,Exposure vs. Inclusion in Shared Locker Room Spaces,"1. **Specificity**: Exposure vs. Inclusion in Shared Locker Room Spaces

"And how did the ""little guy"" get neglected? The Republicans promised that ""trickle down"" would benefit the little guy. Instead they got ""tinkled on"".

Slavery isn't just some long past forgotten event. It lasted for hundreds of years; today, African-Americans still feel they are second-class citizens.

I'd argue, ""Hell, no!""

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.  I believe suggesting otherwise is unwarranted, unfounded and unbelievable, and also disrespects the independence, judgment and discernment of the other council members...""",Communication breakdown and accountability in city hall process,Defensive Accountability,Accountability and Justification in City Hall Process,"1.

"If any billionaire did me a favor, which is statistically improbable, they would at least do it using their own money. Democrats prefer to do favors using taxpayer's money, but only when it benefits them in getting votes.

Actually, my son was offered a favor from a billionaire once in the form of a job when he gets out of the military. As it so happens, they were seated next to each other on an airplane flight, in coach. The guy didn't believe in owning a private airplane or flying first class. My son checked this guy out later, and he was legitimate.

""Angry white people blaming government for our failures in life?"" I thought we were the privileged, the 1 percent. Funny how liberals use both sides of an argument as it suits them.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats.""

He programmed that boy with anti-white hate and seated within him a great fear of law enforcement officers.

"Sorry, Bob, Hillory the Blood Countess PROMISED to ""obliterate"" (her word) the Islamic Republic of Iran--that's 70 million human beings--with tactical nuclear weapons at an appearance before a Dartmouth University crowd just last year (07/03/15).

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them.

Then you throw out a bare straw man argument about Bill Clinton and infidelity.  
Mr. Trump is on his 3rd marriage, of which he proudly admits he cheated on his now wives and with other mistresses.  He makes tasteless sexual remarks about his own daughters.  He shows no respect to the women in his life that he should show ultimate respect to.

Mrs. Clinton made her decision regarding her marriage infidelity and for whatever reason chose to keep her marriage intact.  The Clinton's raised a daughter who is a college graduate and a successful working woman.

"I don't think she can  afford to play nice.  That's a mistake many liberals make, assuming others will naturally agree with them.   'If we treat them kindly, they will love us and be transformed'.  Not in a 60 minute debate, not with Donald Trump.

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.      I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.  

The question for a significant number of American's is: can Hillary Clinton  be a leader among men? (foreign and domestic).  Cleary many Americans like an 'alpha dog' style of leadership.    Very few people feel Clinton is entittled to anything... she has to fight.

A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by.

"Perhaps Robert should look at it from our point of view. As Americans, we are tired of the degradation of our country. Democrats are no longer democrats, but disguised communists. They no longer represent hard working Americans. They pander to who will vote for them- welfare royalty and the ""Gimme Free!"" crowd.  FDR started and LBJ continued this trend of stealing from the ""rich"" (anybody that works) and giving it to those that don't.  We are currently at the balance of 60% who work, 40% sucking on the public tit.  Republicans are not any different. The ""hands across the aisle"" is code for ""shhh.. we're with you"". Republicans pick the most worthless candidate and expect their members to vote for them.

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

"So what has the Alaskan Department of Fish and Game Commissioner gained from the death of this last male (who has a pregnant female waiting in the wings)?  Nothing I would assume expect the possible extinction of a particular line of wolf which 1000s of people will no longer visit Alaska to see.  Since when does a National Park allow ""thugs"" (posing as hunters) to come into its park and kill animals - animals by the sounds of it that are moving towards extinction.  Even if these animals were in excess surely it's the responsibility of the parks board to sort it out and not leave it's borders open to hunters to sort out for them because hunters don't know how to discriminate between what needs to be culled vs what needs to be retained.  You're despicable MR COTTEN.  If YOU have the authority, close the park for the next few years so the wolves can recover - not just for an extra month a year -

"Mike Dunham's request that we ""give black soldiers their due"" is a ridiculous one, at best.  This is not a new story: as other posters have stated, the role of black soldiers' contributions has already been reported in other publications.  Dunham claims ""their role was severely downplayed,"" yet never once states how.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""  It should be noted that this characterized the life of EVERYone who contributed to the Alaska Highway.  Why not honor and recognize the Army Corps of Engineers- all of them?

Wouldn't Alaskans stand to benefit from learning about ALL the varied groups who has contributed to this great stretch of road?

"I simply cannot believe this ramping-up of the PC war against the English language and common sense.  Too many people are getting indignant over imaginary slights created only in their own minds.

(And by the way, for those geographically ignorant Americans --- which is most of them --- who for whatever PC reason prefer the word ""Asian"" to ""Oriental"", let me point out that the continent of Asia consists of MANY more lands, and more peoples, than simply those of the Orient.)

"Alaska better get on the stick with this. This is a SOCIAL EXPERIMENT gone crazy led by the ones in power. The ONLY ones supporting this crap are liberals with NO CHILDREN or females in their lives that they care about. LESS THAN ONE PERCENT of these people claim to be Transgender. See there used to be rules. You get a birth certificate when you are born, and you were not able to make ANY alterations to it. Now, apparently anyone can go and request to change their gender on a birth certificate. WHAAAT?? So there are no rules anymore to keep order. Now WOMENS bathrooms are being targeted as a hot spot for these people. If your born a man, you are a man. No amount of chopping off a penis will make you a lady.

"This is crazy but one summer in Homer there was a fire and traffic backed up and one crazy lady cut in front of me and almost hit me and I gave her a light beep on the horn so she would not hit me. So she whips her vehicle around and speeds up to me, follows me in a parking lot and blocks the driver door and I have a disabled passenger with me in the front seat. She proceeds to get out of her car and loudly berates me and will not move and let me out of my jeep. I sat there and called 911 and the cops came and made her leave me alone. The cops did not charge her with anything and they told me she had some ""major"" personal problems lately. I'll say. So I agree with you I now carry pepper spray handy in the jeep.

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.  That's the way the Nazis thought.  That's the way the da'esh (""ISIS"") thinks now.

Repeatedly missgendering and claiming that a trans person is just ""a boy pretending to be a girl"" or vice versa is hateful and abusive. We are not trading opinions on which is  better pistachio or chocolate ice cream we are talking about a topic that regularly results in bloodshed, 25 trans women murdered last year for nothing more than existing hundreds more assaulted and an unknowable number lost to suicide because of structural abuse like the kind found in the poor handling of comments like these. If the ADN is going to capitalize on the current interest in trans issues it has a resposibility to provide some education and context to these stories and comments.",Inadequate moderation perpetuating transphobic abuse and ignorance,Inadequate Moderation,"**Inadequate Moderation of Transphobic Abuse**

This refined code captures the essence of the comment by highlighting the concern over the inadequate monitoring of hateful and abusive comments, specifically those that involve the misgendering and transphobic language towards trans people. The refined code conveys the idea that the poor handling of transphobic comments contributes to the ongoing violence, assaults, and suicides experienced by the trans community, and that the platform has a responsibility to provide education and context to these stories and comments.

This refined code addresses the specific issue of transphobic abuse, while still incorporating the original ideas of inadequate moderation and education. It provides a clear and concise message to improve moderation and reduce harmful discourse targeted towards the trans community.","1. Inadequate Moderation of Transphobic Abuse

"I suspect someone who is 80 and Black might ask, ""comes to America""? Or someone who lived in Vietnam during the war years and saw hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens killed by American bombs might ask, ""comes to America""?
Or the tens of thousands who died during Bush's Shock and Awe campaign, terrified of American missiles and bombs, might ask, ""comes to America""?
Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor. Of course, he and Jefferson were terrible slaveholding murdering fascists who kept fellow humans in chains so that they could get rich.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.

I also think that a doctor/pharmacy shouldn't ever be forced to write/fill a prescription they don't feel comfortable with.","```plaintext

Yes, a part of this Nation's history contains slaves.  Some of them from Africa where African people captured other African people and sold them to White people.  Yes there are many people today with poor living conditions, education etc which tend to segregate into public housing, living on taxpayer money, single parents, gangs, violence, drugs, riots, and violence.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.
