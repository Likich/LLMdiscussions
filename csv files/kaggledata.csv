You all holler lack of housing. Well most campers if you talk to them are heroin addicts. You never see any kids or families. Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison.. So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news. Most guys were in the 20 to 30 age group. but wear boots needles all over and garbage.,0.5,10,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.5,0.1,0.1666666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,133

I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them.

By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.  I believe suggesting otherwise is unwarranted, unfounded and unbelievable, and also disrespects the independence, judgment and discernment of the other council members...""",0.6,10,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,156

Obama haters have spent the past eight years ranting about how horrible things are under our ""Muslim"" president.  The tea party reared its ugly head, came to power, yet nothing was accomplished. Those same radical extremists have now thrown their weight behind Donald Trump, who offers only vague promises and further divides America with his divisiveness and hateful rhetoric.

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless.

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless.

1845,379877,"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger.
