# LLMdiscussions

LLMdiscussions is a research framework for simulating and analyzing structured discussions among large language models (LLMs). The goal is to understand how different models interact, influence each other, and refine their outputs through iterative "roundtable" discussionsâ€”especially in the context of qualitative coding.
