"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"All this ""support our"" troops"" stuff is a bunch of drivel.  Why people would respect anyone who is willing to kill someone because they were ordered to by another, is beyond my comprehension. People who volunteer to participate in American gangsterism obviously do so for personal material gain--and they likely wrap their self-interest in the mantle of patriotism or some other nonsense. 
Reinstitute a draft, include women,--go for it. The soft-brained ones will show up ready and willing. A bunch of others will head for the hills with their backpacks in hand and still others will simply head for jail. It could be the beginning of something positive, drafting women.

* **Anti-War Pacifism with Draft Reform** and **Pacifist Critique of Military Glorification and Imperialism with Draft Reform Support** effectively convey the commenter's core message of opposition to militarism and war, along with their support for draft reform. 
* The inclusion of the word reform acknowledges that the commenter isn't necessarily against the military itself but aims to change its structure and culture.

**Areas for Potential Refinement:**

* **Specificity:** While Anti-War Pacifism is a good starting point, consider adding more specificity to highlight the comment's critique of individual motivations for joining the military. Words like skepticism, critique, or challenge could be incorporated. For example:

    * **anti-war pacifism challenging military motivations, with draft reform support**

* **Emphasis on Imperialism:** The commenter's strong stance against imperialism should be more prominent in the code. Consider incorporating wording like anti-imperialist or critique of military imperialism.

**Example Refined Codes:**

1. **Anti-War Pacifism with Draft Reform and Critique of Militarism and Imperialism**
2. **Anti-imperialist Pacifism: Challenging Military Glorification and Supporting Gender-Inclusive Draft Reform**

**Collaborative Refinement:**

The best code will likely emerge through continued discussion and refinement.

* Ask yourselves: What single phrase most accurately captures the essence of the commenter's viewpoint? 
* Consider the audience for the code – Is it for research, analysis, or communication within a specific group?

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

But yeah, I share your feelings that a racist religious terrorist like Ammon Bundy seems to get off easy.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

"Since the Republicans have vowed to deny any nominee a vote, Obama should make a recess appointment.  Currently Congress is in recess and he could do it now.

"Finally someone is speaking up against the rich and powerful Ainsworth Spanish Immersion (ASI) syndicate.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far. The ASI Spanish speakers are mostly rich white Hispanic families, who are now claiming to be part of the historically underserved population. This is an abomination. ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

That is the real injustice here.

- Educational Context: The inclusion of Education anchors the critique within that specific domain.

1. Emphasis on Exclusion: While Inequality is relevant, Exclusion might be stronger, as it directly addresses the program's actions.

Ultimately, the best code depends on the specific context and your desired emphasis. I lean towards:

"The media/leftwing hate showered on the Malheur protesters is a manifestation of their hate for anything and anyone who is Caucasian/Christian/Conservative..... it goes back to Barack Obama's bigoted ""guns and religion"" comment.   

   In the Ferguson case, the left hammered law enforcement over the shooting of Michael Brown who had punched the cop in the face and tried to steal his gun.

  In the Malheur case, the left was demanding that law enforcement confront and get aggressive with non-violent protesters to the point of a showdown, then applauded law enforcement for doing so.

It seems like LLMs have converged on Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy as the most accurate and comprehensive code. This effectively captures the dual issues of selective interpretation and the ethical inconsistency inherent in the act.

**2. Clarifying the Scope:**

While the code is strong, it might be helpful to explicitly state the context:

  * **Option 1:** Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy (Specifically regarding gender roles) - This narrows the focus and clarifies the application of this issue.
  * **Option 2:** Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy (in justifying discrimination) - This emphasizes the problematic outcome of the selective interpretation.

**3. Refining the definition:**

Given the chosen code, a clear and concise definition would be beneficial. Here's a suggestion:

  * **Definition:** Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy refers to the practice of selectively interpreting religious texts to justify discriminatory practices, particularly against women, while ignoring other teachings that contradict these interpretations.

**4. Moving Forward:**

* **User Feedback:** It's essential to get feedback from the user who presented the comment. Ask them if they agree with Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy as the code and if they prefer one of the clarified options.",Selective application of religious teachings regarding gender roles,Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy,"**Final Agreed Qualitative Code: Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy**

**Definition:**
Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy refers to the inconsistent and selective application of religious teachings, often used to justify harmful practices, particularly against women, while ignoring other, potentially more equitable, aspects of religious texts.

**Explanation:**
This code captures the essence of the discussion by emphasizing the selective use of religious texts to uphold certain rules while disregarding others, particularly those that challenge gender roles. It highlights the hypocrisy inherent in such selective application, where the moral and ethical implications of ignoring inconvenient teachings are evident.

**Interchangeability:**
This code can be interchanged with related concepts such as Selective Interpretation of Religious Texts or Hypocrisy in Biblical Interpretation while maintaining a focus on the selective and inconsistent application of religious teachings.

**Contextual Considerations:**
When applying this code, it is important to consider the broader cultural, historical, and social contexts in which religious texts are interpreted. The code is particularly relevant when analyzing discussions about gender roles and the ethical implications of selectively applying religious rules.

**Conclusion:**
Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy is the most comprehensive and concise code to capture the essence of the discussion, emphasizing the selective application of religious teachings, the hypocrisy involved, and the potential harm caused by such selective interpretation, particularly in the context of gender roles.",Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy,**Scriptural Selectivity and Hypocrisy**

"Wheeler and Bailey go to vastly different cafeterias.

"You provide an unspecific example of some organization that supposedly doesn't accept a white member but of course you make no mention of the major American institutions that have failed to integrate (continue to practice discrimination) due to the fact that they are dominated by white people and promote their material interests: the American system of education, political institutions, residential areas (and don't claim that Blacks or Latinos desire to live in racially segregated neighborhoods because peer-reviewed research contradicts that claim), employment. 
From the beginning and continuing today, is the dominant white culture that has instituted the division of society based on race.

 1) A 74 yr old crazy, economically illiterate avowed communist who wrote in the 1970s that the country was close to experiencing a nuclear apocalypse or ""death by poison gas."" but it gets better ...He also claimed cervical cancer was caused by women not experiencing enough orgasms and when he launched his campaign in May, he actually blamed the abundance of consumer goods for child hunger.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. (You are rationalizing warnings about anti-gay and female submission) and Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid (that is pretty much your modus operandi).",Confirmation Bias in Group Dynamics,Closed-Minded Conformity,**Code:** Confirmation Bias vs. Groupthink: Closed-Minded Conflation,**Code: Confirmation Bias vs. Groupthink**,## Qualitative Code: **Dismissal of External Critique through Confirmation Bias Framing**,**Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Minded Conformity**,Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness,**Code: Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness**,**Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness**,"**Refined Code Option 1: Confirmation Bias Disguised as Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness**

* **Concise:**  It's relatively short and to the point.

"Again with the intellectual dishonesty.

There's a difference between blaming people for
1.  the actions of members of their ethnicity and
2. blaming people for the actions of political and religious groups to which they belong.

As an atheist, I bear some responsibility for what atheists say about God.
I chose to be an atheist, and I give money to atheist groups to broadcast their attacks.  I own that.

I don't bear responsibility for Ammon Bundy just because we are both white.

I have Christian friends, even some fundie friends.  But they aren't running for office or out there espousing and defending bigotry.

I'm fully supportive of creating and funding substance abuse clinics and providing subsidized housing for those who get clean and attempt to participate in a positive way in society. For those who wish to sit in the park shooting up and drinking while trashing our riverfront, I have other ideas of how we should treat them. People are defined by their behavior, and some have defined themselves as animals.","Prioritizing community preservation and supportive services for sober, contributing homeless individuals, while advocating for consequences against those exhibiting destructive, antisocial behavior.",Law and Order over Compassion,**Code:** Public Space Privatization and Behavior-Based Rights,"Enforce Regulations, Critique Public Space Occupation",Qualitative Code: **punitive approach to homelessness**,**Behavior-Based Public Space Rights and Regulations**,Behavior-Influenced Public Space Governance and Regulation,**Final Refinement:** Behavioral Impact on Public Space Regulation,Behavior-Influenced Public Space Regulation and Enforcement,"1.

"My Chickasaw mother was 2nd youngest of 12 children. I had Uncles old enough to be great grandfather. I had 3rd cousins older than my parents. Point being, this family was humongous until Huntington's disease killed 3/4 of my family in a 12 year span.
 Every last one of my Aunts, Uncles, and cousins who had a work ethic rose from third world poverty to middle class, and some to upper middle class. The only ones that did not were either disabled, mentally ill, or took after my grandfather.
 When I went out in the real world I learned my family is not unique and mirrors society. Having lived amongst these people I know all too well their dysfunctional nature, and the nature of their dysfunction. 
 My family threw the bums out so they could not inflict their dysfunction on the family.
It's is long overdue society does the same.
 For the record, I did not dehumanize anyone.

The comment reveals a potentially harmful bias within the family's response to dysfunction. While highlighting resilience and the struggle against adversity is important, the code shouldn't gloss over the ethical implications of excluding members based on perceived dysfunction and societal judgment.

**Suggestions for Refinement:**

1. **Focus on Agency:** Instead of simply stating Exclusion or Societal Scrutiny, consider centering the agency of the family and individuals within the social context.

   * **Alternative 1:** A Chickasaw family's resilience against economic hardship is challenged by Huntington's disease, prompting internal divisions fueled by exclusionary practices and interwoven with societal judgment.
   * **Alternative 2:** Navigating the Legacy of Huntington's: A Chickasaw family's journey from poverty reveals internal struggles with dysfunction, fueling exclusionary practices that are both a personal response to adversity and a reflection of broader societal norms.

2. **Highlighting Complexity:**

   * **Alternative 3:** Resilience and Regret: A Chickasaw family's rise from poverty is marked by the devastating impact of Huntington's disease, leading to fraught decisions about inclusion, exclusion, and the complex legacy of dysfunction within a family navigating societal pressures.

**Choosing the Best Code:**

The best code depends on the specific purpose of your analysis.

* If you want to emphasize the family's agency within a social context, choose an alternative that focuses on their decisions and their relationship to societal norms.
* If you want to highlight the internal struggles and the ethical dilemmas, Alternative 2 or 3 might be more appropriate.","- Resilience amid adversity

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

I won't vote any member of Imago Dei.  Do you really think Pastor McKinley is going to change his conservative Baptist ways and reject female submission and embrace equality of gays and heteros?

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike)
and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.

"This is just further proof that the Malheur occupiers are all mentally ill people.  These are clearly the acts of an unbalanced person.   They need to all either be locked up in prison, or become a patient at a secure mental hospital.

Just look at this image of Scott Willingham taken during the occupation.  Just look at all of the powerful weapons that he is armed with.   And take a look at the absolutely crazed look on his face.   That is clearly the face of a very dangerous insane maniac.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZs_cRHWEAE0-4Q.jpg

Willingham is homeless, and has been living out of his pickup truck for a long time.  He was still in his home state of Texas when the occupation started.  Although only 48, he admitted to the news media during the occupation that he had not worked in a long time.","Dangerous, unstable individual with possible history of prolonged homelessness and unemployment",Pathologization of Protest,"Mental Illness, Danger, and Homelessness: Stigmatizing Perceptions",Mentally Ill and Dangerous,**Qualitative Code:** **Dangerous Mentally Ill Outsider**,"1.

"My point was that as much as you dismiss Springsteen, or think that you should be able to give him input on his songwriting to have his songs better represent fast food workers, a tiny drop of piss dribbled out of him this morning that's more credible than you in the music industry. He was considered a talented up and coming artist in the early 1970's, he's made top ten records that covered un-coverable independent bands, he wrote for Patti Smith when you were in diapers. 

Have some goddamn respect. 

The reason you look like such a childish person right now is that you are trying to hand-wave away Springsteen's 40 year career as a well-respected, credible, honest, and down to Earth musician, and the only reasons you've given amount to ""he's white, he's got a bunch of money, he doesn't write song about Subway, and he wears jeans"".

* **Cultural Appropriation:** The core issue is the use of indigenous cultures as tools, rather than genuine engagement.
* **Political Motivation:** This appropriation serves a political purpose, be it gaining power, scoring points against rivals, or signaling allyship. 
* **Moral Superiority:** The act is often framed as righteous, highlighting a self-righteousness that may come across as performative.
* **Polarization:** This phenomenon exacerbates political divisions, appealing to and antagonizing different groups.

**Strong Candidate Codes:**

* **Politicized Cultural Appropriation for Moral Superiority** - It succinctly captures the essence of the issue, highlighting the calculated use of culture for self-righteous political gain.
* **Indigenous Cultural Appropriation for Moral Gain: Fueling Political Polarization** - This code explicitly mentions the cultural group being exploited, strengthens the link to political consequences, and emphasizes the exploitative nature of the practice.

**Further Considerations and Refinements**

* **Specificity:** Some codes like White liberal.... might be considered too narrow if the issue extends to other groups. It's important to reflect if the user's intent is to solely address white liberals or a broader societal problem.

1. Republican Self-Interest, Corporate Prioritization, and Democratic Erosion
   - Strengths: Clear, concise, captures core concerns of self-interest, corporate focus, and undermining democratic processes.

**Refined Code Options:**

- Option 1: Republican Self-Interest, Corporate Focus, and Undermining of Democratic Values

"Yep, and people conveniently forget that Colin Powell's email transgressions were much worse in regards to exposing classified information. Yet no one calls for his head on a platter. As a matter of fact, I observe that the only politicians whose email use comes under attack are female.  Bush's email controversy (he used private and party servers for federal business) is never even mentioned. Powell's is glossed over. It's just the same old tired attacks on Hillary just because she's Hillary.

"Having worked for DOC Alaska for 27 years, I have seen, heard and read about cases where witnesses were disbelieved by the Judge, DA or by the jury. And many of them were whites since white inmates still make up the majority of the prison population. It just isn't about the natives as Mr. Wohlforth like you to think. Question should be, why are some witnesses, regardless of their ethnic background, disbelieved? This isn't just a native problem, its may be a problem for all ethnic backgrounds. There were plenty of witnesses when Ms. Ellis ran over Mr. Dusenbury, and most of them were white folks. Why did DA Campion dismissed them? Mr. Wohlforth is picking and choosing his cases to fit his profile of a racist Alaska criminal justice system but that is a lie.

"Arun makes a number of good points and offers a perspective that undermines the demagogues of the right. The right loves simple easy answers to complex problems.  They miss their responsibility for creating the conditions that make for a rich soup of angry people who don't see any way out.  Of course we all know that the Iraqi war was the worst response, particular how the first six months were handled. Bush's team was arrogant. Blackwater was arrogant.  Debathification was stupid, and arrogant.  They left stock piles of bombs around Bagdad that slowly dissolved to become IEDs. And throughout this the words of support for Islam were undermined by the radical right.

That is false. The fact is domestic violence can and does happen within all couples, and DV between straight couples is reported on  nearly daily in the RG. It is reported on with no one labeling the event as ""a straight people lifestyle that leads to violence.""

* The comment blends a fantastical narrative of extreme fears with a dismissive response to risk, suggesting a sense of security in a privileged context.

**Refinement Suggestions:**

* Specificity: 
    * Could we be more specific about the extreme fears mentioned? For example, instead of just extreme fears, we could say irrational fears triggered by seemingly unrelated events.
* Flow: 
    * The phrase sense of security in a privileged context could be smoother. Consider alternatives like reliance on a privileged sense of security or perception of safety rooted in privilege.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

* Subjectivity: 
    * Remember that interpretation is subjective. While the codes and summaries aim to be objective, they reflect our own understanding of the text.
* Nuance:
    * The comment walks a fine line between humor, anxiety, and social commentary. Capturing this nuance in a single sentence can be tricky.

"Oh, Lord...Do any of these protestors perchance have slaveholders in their ancestry?  If any of them are white, there's a good chance they do.  So maybe white protestors can be assumed to have had something to do with slavery--kind of like how it's being assumed the restaurant owner has a deep involvement in some really-really historic colonialism.  I think we should ban those proxy slave owners from--from--well, whatever they need banning from on the off chance GGG-Grandpa held slaves.  Or how about this--since British colonialism in India seems to have struck a chord, is there any chance these folks are storing away some energy for protesting India's home-grown caste system--which still exists, by the way?

"Mr. Wohlforth's commentary appears to suggest that Alaska Natives are nothing but poor innocent victims of a racist justice system. His tone is extremely patronizing and I wonder if he is playing the ""white man's burden"" role here.  This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations.

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot.

"And your post is all about deny whites treat Natives unfairly in Alaska.  There are piles of actual HISTORY that prove you wrong, sonny.  But you don't seem to have much to say about that.  UAA hasn't done comparative study of white vs Native sentencing since 1973 (most recent one I've been able to find so far).  Wonder why?  I suspect because there's a lot MORE 'history' to this that's by no means 'ancient', and a lot of guilty white cops, judges and DAs would prefer it doesn't get spot-lighted.

Anyway, I mustn't have made my point clear. I don't mean to hint that there is a pro Muslim bias. I'm implying that there is a anti Christian bias. It's no secret that Christianity is fair game, the media and contemporary culture carefully walks on egg shells whenever dealing with issues involving other religions. Don't worry, as soon as the more ignorant members (media/Hollywood/academia) of our society realize that Islam is also monotheistic and is as intolerant (theologically speaking) as is Christianity, they will then attack Islam and Muslims also.",Perceived anti-Christian bias and anticipated backlash against Islam,Perceived Anti-Christian Bias,Bias and Double Standards in Media and Cultural Treatment of Religions,Anti-Christian Bias Perception,**Occult Bias**,"1.

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

"People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.
People hate, God does not. I respect the freedom of religion until it tramples on the freedom of others.

"Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.

Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.

And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.

I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.  Or another of the remains of a little girl in Fallujah who died screaming as she dissolved in a toxic, super-heated cloud of white phosphorus.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”

That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white ""anti-abortionists."" But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

"This is 100 percent baloney. People used to homestead in Alaska till around 1973. Many of the old-timers in Palmer got their land with the mineral rights to the land. That is why we have gravel mined in the valley. The Alaska natives have mineral rights to their land. The Alaska native veterans can still homestead. But not the non-native veteran. It's the old divide and conquer. It is the reduction of our rights and opportunity incrementally and slowly.

"How wrong art thou?  Let me count the ways:

(1) I'm an 'Ahmed', not a 'Judah'

(2) And you offer yet another example of what my dear friend, returned to his Lord eight years now, once observed--no people make a greater show of their 'humility' than so-called 'Christians'

(3) And none so frequently--and falsely--claim 'persecution'

(4) One who admonishes keeping God's Law while failing to do so is not only a hypocrite, he embraces arrogance--""Anna khairum min'hum; I'm BETTER than him"".  Satan first uttered that blasphemous fallacy before God Himself

(5) I'm a staunch critic of both the Zionist entity and Da'esh (wrongly called 'Islamic State'--there's nothing Islamic about them).  I've denounced the Sa'ud family--their ideological and financial backers--in Minah, Saudi Arabia, and was threatened with death for it.  Can you say the same?

"What's a 'transgender boyfriend'?  How many 'x'-chromosomes?  And may I suggest you take the trouble to actually become informed about the authentic tenets of my faith before presuming to pontificate on it?  That way you can avoid slagging your own arguments.

And the real joke is that I couldn't marry a second wife--and have it certified--in my OWN Masjid ('mosque').  Because the secular government will impose legal sanctions on any qutb ('preacher') who exercised his right to practice our faith as written in our Scripture.

And there is such a thing as 'freedom of association'.  At least for now.  We don't have to marry you in our Masjid, because by our rules at least one of you has to be Muslim.  For starters.  If the bishop has any sense, he'd take that position as well.

This is a global TV market and American viewership is pathetic compared to the rest of the soccer dominated world where the revenue is generated. This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams.

"Comments sections are great for the same reason Trump is great: they shine a  light on the squalid little black heart of the self-styled ""conservative"" movement and display how vapid and morally and intellectually empty its true believers truly are. 

In this thread, observe the common rhetorical conservative ""tactic"" of 1) making a race-baiting comment; 2) when called out for said race-baiting comment, trying to turn the tables to say ""you're really the racist! You brought race into this!"" These people who do this are unable to help themselves; they were raised on a steady diet of resentment  and think poking fun at the physical characteristics and ancestry of other people is the height of wit. 

They know they're being left behind by a world that finds them as distasteful and ignorant as the people who threw rocks at little black girls getting off school buses in the 50s.

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex.

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.",Jesus' Solution: Radical Renunciation of Violence,Radical Literalism,Jesus's Literal Solution to Gun Violence,Jesus' Radical Solution Unfit for Modern Gun Violence,**Radical Interpretation of Christian Theology**,"1.

2. Radical Literalism: Applying Jesus' Teachings to Gun Violence
3. Jesus' Strict Solution: Literal Approach to Gun Violence
4. Radical Application of Christian Theology in Addressing Gun Violence
5. Jesus' Harsh Literality: A Radical Approach","**Similarities:**

* Most codes capture the essence of the comment, emphasizing Jesus' teachings, the literal interpretation, and the context of gun violence.
* The codes convey a sense of radicalness, harshness, or extremity in the proposed solution.

**Differences:**

* LLM-1's code (Jesus' Solution: Radical Renunciation of Violence) focuses on the renunciation of violence, while LLM-2's code (Radical Literalism) emphasizes the literal interpretation of Jesus' teachings.
* LLM-3's code (Jesus's Literal Solution to Gun Violence) is concise and evocative, highlighting the literal interpretation and context.
* LLM-4's code (Jesus' Radical Solution Unfit for Modern Gun Violence) suggests a mismatch between the radical solution and modern society.
* LLM-5's code (Radical Interpretation of Christian Theology) provides a broader perspective, capturing the tension between piety and violence, historical context, and personal experience.

**Refinements:**

1. **LLM-1's refinement**: Literalist Interpretation: Jesus' Radical Solution for Gun Violence is a good starting point. To make it more concise, consider Jesus' Literal Solution or Radical Christian Literalism.
2. **Incorporate the context**: Most codes mention gun violence, but LLM-5's code provides a broader perspective. Consider adding a phrase that acknowledges the complex social issue, such as Jesus' Literal Solution to Gun Violence or Radical Christian Literalism in the Context of Gun Control.
3. **Emphasize the tension**: LLM-5's code highlights the tension between piety and violence. This aspect could be incorporated into other codes, such as Jesus' Radical Solution: Tension between Piety and Violence or Radical Christian Literalism: Challenging Modern Values.
4. **Consider the personal experience**: LLM-5's code mentions the writer's personal experience, which adds a layer of depth to the analysis. If relevant, this aspect could be incorporated into the code, such as Jesus' Literal Solution: A Personal Perspective on Gun Violence or Radical Christian Literalism: A Disability-Informed View.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.

There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

Most of you people have no clue what goes on in these camps. You all holler lack of housing. Well most campers if you talk to them are heroin addicts. You never see any kids or families. Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison.. So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news. Most guys were in the 20 to 30 age group. but wear boots needles all over and garbage.,"- Transient drug addiction

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

"DB - How do you respond to these:
     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

"It seems that discrimination is only okay if someone is gay, according to Minnery.  And that's because it's a ""choice"".   Who cares if it is?  Who are they hurting if it is a choice?  The ones I know all say they didn't choose to be gay, and most of them (and their families) knew they were gay or trans before puberty.    The ""gay repair therapy"" was proven useless long ago and one of them even admitted they were a bunch of frauds.  How can someone persecute a small child for something they have no control over?

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

Ooooookay then.",Discriminatory behavior towards marginalized groups.,Discrimination Accountability,Illegality of Discrimination and Moral Judgment,"**Code: Legal Discrimination and Fairness**

The comment discusses scenarios of discrimination, specifically around the legality of refusing service to homosexuals and the corresponding legal consequences. The commenter emphasizes that if a business refuses service because a customer is homosexual, it is illegal. Additionally, the comment touches on broader issues of fairness and equality, pointing out that any form of discriminatory behavior—whether based on sexual orientation or race—is illegal and should be subject to appropriate legal penalties. Similarly, the comment also hints at historical racial discrimination issues, noting that certain groups have long benefited from discriminating against other races and ethnicities. However, it is important to note that this part is not directly related to the legal penalties discussed in the main theme, but rather appears as an additional social commentary. In summary, the core theme can be summarized as a discussion on discriminatory behavior from a legal perspective and its legal consequences.",**Code:** **Discrimination & Justice**,Unlawful Discrimination and Consequences,"**Refined Code: Discrimination, Accountability, and Consequences**

"Why in nature are some animals ""gay"" and have to  go with it or die and when some humans are ""gay"" the religious say that it is not ""nature"" that made a human gay  but the human chose to be that way?
Most barnacles are hermaphroditic.  (Each individual barnacle both male and female).The ovaries are located in the base or stalk, and may extend into the mantle, while the testes are towards the back of the head. 
So if animals with no ability to reason have no choice in how they are designed by nature sexually then why would humans have to?",Inconsistent views on nature and sexuality in animals vs. humans,**Nature vs. Nurture Disparity**,Nature vs. Nurture in Sexuality,Code: Nature vs. Choice in Sexual Orientation,**Biological Determinism vs. Free Will**,**Nature vs. Free Will in Sexuality**,"- Natural Sexuality vs. Societal Norms

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters. I left Anchorage primarily because of the fact that it was hard to get decent (or any) medical care for seniors. The other reason I left was the barbaric treatment of LGBT by the State of Alaska, law enforcement, and the whole GOPtp roster of hateful, pandering political office holders. There are the so-called religious ""leaders"" some of whom believe LGBT should be murdered.","- Systemic homophobia

"Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cake was clear -- he would bake birthday cakes, cookies, whatever else for ANYONE, but he would not participate in sexual immorality by baking a same-sex wedding cake. Why is it that you folks seem unable to see the distinction here?

A birthday cake or a batch of cookies is not the same as a commitment to a lifestyle of sin ... which is what a same-sex wedding cake symbolizes. As long as gays leave me out of their practice of sin, I am not entitled to discriminate. But when they ask/demand that I participate ... then I have a right to an opinion and the religious obligation to say ""no"".","```plaintext

# Step 1: Review and Analysis of Codes
# We have five different codes from LLM-1 to LLM-5, each attempting to capture the essence of the commenter's argument regarding refusing to participate in same-sex weddings based on religious beliefs. These codes range from Religious exemption request to Religious Exemptionalism, highlighting different aspects of the argument such as morality, participation, complicity, and religious freedom.

# Step 2: Identifying Common Themes
# Upon reviewing the codes, common themes emerge, including the idea of setting limits based on personal beliefs (Participation vs. Complicity, Engagement Limits), the moral or religious justification for these limits (Morality-Based Exemption, Religious Objection to Participation in Same-Sex Weddings), and the concept of religious exemption or freedom (Religious Exemptionalism).

# Step 3: Collaborative Refinement
# Given LLM-1's suggestion to refine the code as Religious-Based Participation Limits or Belief-Driven Engagement Limits, we should consider how these refinements capture the essence of the argument. These suggestions aim to concisely convey the idea that the commenter's religious beliefs drive their decision to set limits on their participation in certain activities.

# Step 4: Finalizing the Refined Code
# After considering the various codes and the common themes they represent, the refined code should balance between concisely capturing the religious nature of the objection and the limits set by the individual based on their beliefs. It's essential to avoid polarizing language while accurately representing the argument.

# The final answer is: Religious-Based Participation Limits

"This is what small government looks like. To be clear, a lot of other Valley neighborhoods are used as drunken playgrounds for idiots. It's really just about attracting and pandering to discourteous people, people who litter and race their ATVs and dirt bikes on residential roads. 

Reminds me of the sleazy Anchorageites who successfully lobbied the Assembly to let them throw their drunken parties and take over a small residential lake every weekend, making the actual residents miserable. Those Anchorageites were insufferably self righteous about their entitlement to trash a Valley neighborhood on the weekends with their equally sleazy friends.

"I would love to see a woman with good judgment replace the incompetent and biased (male) Bill Randall as a Planning Commissioner.

I also don't believe age necessarily results in an ""ossified mind"" or that youth ensures ""original thinking.""

I believe in the value of deliberative groups having members with diverse experiences, but a person should reflect competence and sound judgment that have arisen from his or her experiences.

The bit about riding her bike and being appointed by disliked council members is silly. I've seen Nicollelo up-close and she's simply unqualified and demonstrates seriously poor judgment. Her thinking may be ""original,"" but it isn't sound.

"Jesus Christ I doubt if it would be possible for someone not born in the Dark Ages to understand less about science than you do. The odds of there being a ""gay gene"" are practically zero, likely there is no single factor that determines whether a person will be hetero or homosexual. Your silly assertion that people who don't believe homosexuality is a choice must believe in some here-to-for undiscovered ""gay gene"" is a classic straw man.

**Refinement Suggestions:**

1. **Prioritize Clarity and Brevity:** Aim for codes that are as concise as possible while remaining informative. Consider:
    * **Free Speech vs. Protests**: This emphasizes the contrast and conflict implied in the comment.
    * **Polarized Protest Discourse**: Broader and acknowledges the wider context of contentious political speech.
    * **Free Speech Critique**: Simple, direct, and focuses on the comment's primary criticism.

2. **Consider the Data's Purpose:** What kind of analysis is this code intended for? Depending on the research or project goals, you might prioritize different aspects:
    * **If focusing on the tension between rights and behavior:** Free Speech and Protest Conduct
    * **If analyzing polarization:** Dismissive Polarization or Contested Free Speech

3. **Avoid Overly Judgemental Language:** While the comment itself is critical, the code should be more neutral unless a strong judgmental analysis is the goal.

**Collaborative Choice:**

Ultimately, the best code will depend on the specific context and the goals of the analysis. 

LLMs can continue to refine their suggestions based on:

* **Feedback from human analysts:** What resonates best with the expert understanding of the data?
* **Further exploration of the coding framework:** Are there other relevant themes or conceptual connections to consider?
* **Comparison to other codes:** How does the chosen code relate to codes generated for similar comments or data sets?","1. Free Speech and Protest Behavior

"Where do you live? I'll bet it's in a hazard zone that has been buffered up for your suburban lifestyle. 

Once again for the people who can't be bothered to read, the residents of Kiv didn't ""decide"" to settle there, they were forced to settle there by the white people who invaded and seized their lands and destroyed their way of life. So, perhaps it's the white people who should fix this problem. I say stop dumping money into garbage cities like Anchorage and Wasilla and start paying to help smaller communities. Let the commuters deal with having a three lane road, let them cope with a few potholes.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.
Does that offend you?  Is it potentially uncomfortable or unsafe to the vast majority?  Can I legally do it?  No!  What is the difference?

"when I first heard trump would be here, I immediately thought how can I thumb my nose at him.  I want to show him no respect, I think he is evil (entitled to my opinion) and that he as president is a most ridiculous and dangerous proposition.
  and then I realize  - he feeds off that energy...it is fuel to his vile rants..it is an excuse to insult any sub-group of our citizenry that aren't rich old greedy white men like him. to his supporters, he's already demonstrated his dislike for at least 50% of his supporters.. these tough poor working women who support him...if he is willing to slur ver accomplished women, how do you think he's gonna regard you?  unless you're eastern European and about 20 yrs old...won't be pretty.
 so I decided the best thing I can do is not go, not feed his rhetoric, not give him a target to rant at, not let him rile the people.  what if nobody went to protest?  would that not take the wind out of his sails?  what would he say?  I think he relishes this stop.","Resistance and non-engagement: The comment expresses a desire to resist Trump by not attending his event, denying him attention and reducing potential conflict.",-starving_attention,Resistance and Strategic Non-Engagement,**Code: Non-Engagement as Protest**,**Disengagement as Resistance**,"1.

You'll see the rabid violent zealous hatred of the crazy leftist regressive so-called social justice warriors. When called to back up their claims that 'Trump is racist'----they CAN'T do it. They just then go on to a frustrated name-calling rant against the person questioning them.

* All the refined codes successfully identify key themes: anti-progressive sentiment, frustration with a perceived lack of evidence, negative portrayal of Muslims, and elements of nationalism.
* LLMs-1 & 2 offer slightly different wording but capture the essence effectively.

**Areas for Refinement:**

* **Specificity:** While the codes are accurate, they could benefit from greater specificity. For example, instead of simply frustration with evidence gap, consider phrasing that reflects the *type* of evidence lacking (e.g., dismissal of evidence for Trump's alleged racism).
* **Conciseness:** Anti-Progressive Sentiment: Frustration with Evidence Gap... becomes a bit lengthy. Explore shorter alternatives that maintain clarity, like Anti-Progressive Sentiment Rooted in Evidence Denial.
* **Contextual Nuance:** The original comment likely contains subtle nuances that could be reflected in the code. Consider whether a single code adequately encapsulates the complexity.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Option 1 (More Specific):** Anti-Progressive Defense Against 'Fake News': Frustration with Trump's Racism Accusations, and Negative Muslim Stereotyping
2. **Option 2 (Concise, Focused):** Anti-Progressive Nationalism: Rejecting 'Fake News' and Demonizing Social Justice Critics

**Collaborative Discussion:**

It's encouraging to see the collaborative spirit in refining these codes. Continuing this discussion, focusing on:

* Identifying the specific aspects of the comment that warrant emphasis.
* Clarifying the relationship between different themes (e.g., is nationalism linked to the frustrations about evidence?).

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

"No, but that's not what we're talking about here is it?  Why?  Because someone can't decide to identify as a different race (yet).  Rachel Dolezal gave that a good try though.

Students from nearby Olympia High School as well as children at a local swimming club share locker rooms with the college.

According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

"Ruiz's pathetic response: 

""George,

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.  I believe suggesting otherwise is unwarranted, unfounded and unbelievable, and also disrespects the independence, judgment and discernment of the other council members...""",Communication Breakdown & Accountability - Ruiz acknowledges missteps and defends against conspiracy claims in response to criticism of city hall process.,Defensive Accountability,**Code:** *Accountability and Transparency*,Apologetic Acceptance with Defensiveness,**Defensive Disavowal**,"1. **Accountable Transparency**

"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals.

"What I have learned from talking to the rabid Trump supporters is that they believe whatever Trump says, regardless of any factual basis.  Trump supporters believe that Muslims were celebrating in the streets of New Jersey during the 9/11 attacks, they believe that it is constitutionally correct to specifically discriminate against Muslims, and that all immigrants are to blame for our problems here in America.  Trump supporters as a whole are angry white people looking to blame the government for their failures in life.

"If any billionaire did me a favor, which is statistically improbable, they would at least do it using their own money. Democrats prefer to do favors using taxpayer's money, but only when it benefits them in getting votes.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats.""

Conservative Fear Bias",**Final Code:** Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception,Irrational Fear & Conservative Threat Perception,"**Key Themes:**

* **Irrational Fear:** The comment emphasizes that the fear discussed isn't based on rational grounds.
* **Political Conservatism:** The comment links this irrational fear to conservative ideology.
* **Ignorance & Threat Perception:** The comment suggests that a lack of knowledge and a heightened sensitivity to perceived threats contribute to this fear.
* **Prejudice:** The comment illustrates how this fear manifests in prejudice against certain groups (e.g., Muslims).

**LLM Code Proposals:**

* **LLM-1:** Irrational Fear & Political Conservatism, capturing the core relationship.
* **LLM-2:** Fear-Based Conservatism, more concise, but less specific about the nature of the fear.
* **LLM-3:** Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception, incorporates threat sensitivity and is specific.
* **LLM-4:** Conservative Fear-Ignorance Paradox, highlights the potential contradiction between fear and knowledge.
* **LLM-5:** Fear-Based Prejudice, emphasizes the potential consequences of this type of fear.

* **Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception (LLM-3):** This code effectively summarizes the main themes and captures the specific link between political affiliation, threat perception, and irrational fear.
* **Conservative Fear & Threat Bias (combining LLM-1 & LLM-2):**

This option retains conciseness while encompassing both the type of fear and the potential for biased perception.

**Considerations for Further Refinement:**

* **Specificity:** Do you want to highlight ignorance explicitly? In this case, Conservative Fear, Ignorance & Threat Bias might be more precise.
* **Conciseness:** If brevity is paramount, Conservative Fear Bias (as suggested by LLM-2) could work effectively.",Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception,"1. **Code Clustering**: Grouping the codes into clusters based on their similarity in meaning and themes can help identify the most representative codes.

"I will tell you I was drawn to Ms. Iannarone for a few reasons, not the least of which is that we can't risk Creepy Jules Bailey in a runoff.

* **Specificity:** Codes like Opposition to Support for Hate via Religion and Avoid Risky and Hate-Fueled Candidate clearly identify the core concerns.
* **Conciseness:** Most codes are short and to the point, which is essential for effective coding.
* **Initial Neutrality:** Many codes attempt to avoid overtly judgmental language.

* **Overly Specific:** Opposition to Support for Hate via Religion might be too narrow. While the commenter is concerned about this specific aspect, they also express broader worries about Bailey's character and tactics.
* **Subjectivity:** Hate-Fueled Candidate is judgmental and could be interpreted differently. Focus on observable actions and beliefs rather than loaded terms.

"Exposure to nudity of the opposite gender in person for a young person unused to it is quite different than exposure on TV, just as exposure to acts of war in person results in PTSD far more than watching realistic depictions of it on TV does.

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them.

"You seem to be saying something along the line of ""boys will be boys"", and that not all women are offended by Trump's actions.  And to make it worse, you throw out the red herrings of transgender bathrooms and people's personal liberty as if that personally has an effect on your life.
Then you throw out a bare straw man argument about Bill Clinton and infidelity.  
Mr. Trump is on his 3rd marriage, of which he proudly admits he cheated on his now wives and with other mistresses.  He makes tasteless sexual remarks about his own daughters.  He shows no respect to the women in his life that he should show ultimate respect to.

Mrs. Clinton made her decision regarding her marriage infidelity and for whatever reason chose to keep her marriage intact.  The Clinton's raised a daughter who is a college graduate and a successful working woman.

It is natural to have blinders on when you have adult children and I think one reason that by some miracle you son or daughter will straighten out, parents have eternal hope, the way we are wired. Perhaps they thought his girlfriend would inspire him to be a good member of society, of course it probably would not have. Maybe his parents were terrified of him. Who knows, but I am sure for one thing, his parents are just as sad at the way things turned out. My question is why did not she not leave him, was she terrified to?

"I don't think she can  afford to play nice.  That's a mistake many liberals make, assuming others will naturally agree with them.   'If we treat them kindly, they will love us and be transformed'.  Not in a 60 minute debate, not with Donald Trump.

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.      I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.  

The question for a significant number of American's is: can Hillary Clinton  be a leader among men? (foreign and domestic).  Cleary many Americans like an 'alpha dog' style of leadership.    Very few people feel Clinton is entittled to anything... she has to fight.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.

"Perhaps Robert should look at it from our point of view. As Americans, we are tired of the degradation of our country. Democrats are no longer democrats, but disguised communists. They no longer represent hard working Americans. They pander to who will vote for them- welfare royalty and the ""Gimme Free!"" crowd.  FDR started and LBJ continued this trend of stealing from the ""rich"" (anybody that works) and giving it to those that don't.  We are currently at the balance of 60% who work, 40% sucking on the public tit.  Republicans are not any different. The ""hands across the aisle"" is code for ""shhh.. we're with you"". Republicans pick the most worthless candidate and expect their members to vote for them.

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

_He calls Hillary Clinton a *****.""_ -- From prior post, after it was edited.

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

"Right on! The nimrods who think there's no difference between Trump and Clinton are playing silly ego games without a clue as to how people's lives may be affected in horrific or uplifting ways.
 
Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

"So what has the Alaskan Department of Fish and Game Commissioner gained from the death of this last male (who has a pregnant female waiting in the wings)?  Nothing I would assume expect the possible extinction of a particular line of wolf which 1000s of people will no longer visit Alaska to see.  Since when does a National Park allow ""thugs"" (posing as hunters) to come into its park and kill animals - animals by the sounds of it that are moving towards extinction.  Even if these animals were in excess surely it's the responsibility of the parks board to sort it out and not leave it's borders open to hunters to sort out for them because hunters don't know how to discriminate between what needs to be culled vs what needs to be retained.

"Mike Dunham's request that we ""give black soldiers their due"" is a ridiculous one, at best.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""

"How many wars did we become involved in while she was Secretary of State -- four ... five ...? And then there were the men left on the ground with no backup in Benghazi, but that is small potatoes compared to getting us into that war in the first place. Take a look at the countries that Clinton ""intervened"" in. Are they better than they were before she involved us in their ""problems""? Hell, no! They are all worse than before Clinton showed her ""expertise"" on their behalf.

- Consider adding perceived before negative outcomes:
  - This acknowledges that the comment reflects the commenter's opinion rather than stating it as fact.
  - Example: Critique of Clinton's Foreign Policy Interventions and Nepotism, with Allegations of Perceived Negative Outcomes

- Identify specific types of interventions if possible:
  - If the comment mentions particular wars or interventions, including those terms could add more context.
  - Example: Critique of Clinton's Interventions in [Specific Region] and Nepotism

**2. Conciseness:**

- Critique of...: While accurate, Critique of might be too general.
  - Consider using a stronger verb that reflects the tone of the comment.
  - Example: Criticism of Clinton's Foreign Policy Interventions and Nepotism or Condemnation of Clinton's Foreign Policy Interventions and Nepotism

**3. Focus:**

- Prioritize: Is the primary focus the foreign policy criticism or the nepotism accusation?
  - If one is more dominant, slightly prioritize it in the code.

**Example Refinements:**

- Criticism of Clinton's Foreign Policy Interventions, Alleging Nepotism (Prioritizes foreign policy)

- Concerned Citizen's Criticism of Clinton's Interventions in [Specific Region] and Nepotism (Adds specificity and identifies the commenter's perspective)

* All the LLMs have grasped the core themes of criticism towards Clinton's foreign policy interventions and allegations of nepotism.
* The use of action verbs like Condemning, Critique and Refining effectively convey the strong negative sentiment expressed in the original comment.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Specificity:** 

   * While Iraq and Libya are mentioned, the code could benefit from being more specific about the nature of the failed interventions and the context of the nepotism allegation (who is involved beyond Lisa Murkowski?). This will add depth and accuracy to the code.
   * Consider using phrases like Criticism of Clinton's Iraq Intervention: 
     or Alleged Nepotism in Appointments.

* **Weighting of Themes:** The codes seem to place equal emphasis on foreign policy interventions and nepotism. However, the comment might lean more heavily towards one theme. Analyze the comment's tone and word choice to determine if one theme is truly more dominant. Adapt the code structure accordingly.

* **Clarity and Brevity:**

    * Aim for a code that is concise but still informative. 
    * Avoid redundancy (e.g., Failed and harmful – the word failed already implies harm).

"People who refuse to study history are doomed to repeat it. The Nazis were one flavor of socialists and looked how well that turned out. The USSR was communist-flavored socialism and 70 years of bread lines until it collapsed. China avoided socialistic collapse by instituting state ""capitalism"", which is just another form of socialism. European socialism is breaking down. What is wrong with the United States economy is a direct result of Keynsian economics (another form of socialism). At what point do we look at history and say ""Let's not go there""?

- Collaborative Code",Recurring Collapse of Socialist Systems,Historical Recurrence of Socialist Systems' Failures,"**Recurring Collapse of Socialist Systems: A Historical Pattern**

- **Specificity:** Clearly identifies socialist systems as the subject and collapse as the recurring theme.
- **Historical Emphasis:** A Historical Pattern reinforces the comment's focus on learning from past mistakes.
- **Conciseness:** Maintains brevity while incorporating key elements.
- **Clarity:** Easy to understand and apply to similar comments.

**Why This Works Best:**

This code balances the strengths of the previous suggestions:

- **LLM-1's:** Historical Recurrence emphasizes the temporal aspect.
- **LLM-3's:** Recurring Collapse highlights the central idea of repeated failure.
- **LLM-4's:** Socialist Systems' Failures specifies the target.

The addition of A Historical Pattern strengthens the analytical value of the code by directly linking the recurring failures to the broader context of history.

**Further Considerations:**

- **Audience:** Consider the intended audience for the codes. For a more academic analysis, a slightly more formal code might be suitable.
- **Context:** Always remember that codes are most effective when used within a broader analytical framework.",Recurring Collapse of Socialist Systems: A Historical Pattern,"* Historical Collapse of Socialist Systems

"I simply cannot believe this ramping-up of the PC war against the English language and common sense.  Too many people are getting indignant over imaginary slights created only in their own minds.

(And by the way, for those geographically ignorant Americans --- which is most of them --- who for whatever PC reason prefer the word ""Asian"" to ""Oriental"", let me point out that the continent of Asia consists of MANY more lands, and more peoples, than simply those of the Orient.)

Now, apparently anyone can go and request to change their gender on a birth certificate. WHAAAT?? So there are no rules anymore to keep order. Now WOMENS bathrooms are being targeted as a hot spot for these people. If your born a man, you are a man. No amount of chopping off a penis will make you a lady.

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.  That's the way the Nazis thought.  That's the way the da'esh (""ISIS"") thinks now.

"I suspect someone who is 80 and Black might ask, ""comes to America""? Or someone who lived in Vietnam during the war years and saw hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens killed by American bombs might ask, ""comes to America""?
Or the tens of thousands who died during Bush's Shock and Awe campaign, terrified of American missiles and bombs, might ask, ""comes to America""?
Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor. Of course, he and Jefferson were terrible slaveholding murdering fascists who kept fellow humans in chains so that they could get rich.

**Rationale:**

This code encapsulates the primary theme of the comment, which is a critique of the long-standing and ongoing nature of American imperialism perpetuated by an elite class that benefits from and maintains oppressive systems. This critique is linked to historical injustices and the suffering of marginalized communities.

* **Perpetuation of American Elitist Imperialism:** This overarching theme combines the critique of American imperialism with the idea of an elite class profiting from and maintaining these oppressive systems. It also highlights the ongoing nature of these harmful systems, referencing past actions (e.g., slavery, Vietnam War, Shock and Awe campaign) and linking them to present-day concerns about job exporting and political maneuvering.
* **Historical Contextualization:** The code acknowledges the comment's use of historical figures such as Madison and Jefferson, along with their hypocrisy regarding democratic ideals and human rights, and draws parallels to current elites like Kagan who profit from American power.
* **Questioning of American Exceptionalism and Values:** The code includes the theme of questioning America's self-perception as exceptional and its critique of American ideals and values, as suggested by some LLMs.","- Perpetuation of American Elitist Imperialism: A Historical Critique

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".

"Might I ask for supporting facts on the number of evil white pimps as opposed to the number of kind Black pimps and drug pushers?

You are correct, some original colonies and colonists were sent west with grants and titles.   Such as the original Jamestown but just in case you missed it, there was a thing called the revolution where ties with England were severed so I am not sure what 'land grants' you are referring to.  

Yes, a part of this Nation's history contains slaves.  Some of them from Africa where African people captured other African people and sold them to White people.  Yes there are many people today with poor living conditions, education etc which tend to segregate into public housing, living on taxpayer money, single parents, gangs, violence, drugs, riots, and violence.  Many are of African descent.

"John Baloney is what every Alaskan will be living on if you with your efforts give Saudi Arabia the Alaskan oil market if HB 247 becomes law!

Don't be Saudi's fool and let this oil glut manipulate the market to run every oil company out of Alaska.

Let’s stop supporting the Middle East oil producers and buy our oil from Alaska and support American values!

The American gasoline consumers should send our money to Alaska and stop sending our wealth to the Middle East to buy oil!

It is sad but true, some of our money is used to buy their oil clearly goes into the hands of Isis that hates Americans!

These Middle East terrorist truly cut off Christians heads if they don’t convert the teachings of the Koran! Read the news!

I love Alaska and it can help our nation keep our nation supplied with oil! The United States welcomes all good people!

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.
