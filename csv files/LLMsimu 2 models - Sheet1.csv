"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

This code captures the perceived discrepancy in the response to civil unrest involving Black and White individuals, with harsher measures being taken against White groups despite their actions being characterized as less violent.

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

"Since the Republicans have vowed to deny any nominee a vote, Obama should make a recess appointment.  Currently Congress is in recess and he could do it now.

He was a champion of bigotry, blocking progress for non-heterosexuals at every turn.  He also blocked environmental protection every chance he got.  He had nine children, which is selfish and irresponsible......he was probably opposed to birth control.  And one of his favorite activities was killing defenseless animals for fun.

Wow.  Thanks for this.  I love the disconnect between Bailey attending a somewhat scary church (female submission, anti-gay) and being a progressive.  It shows something hard to define, but not very likable, about his character.  He's kinda wishy-washy.

"Finally someone is speaking up against the rich and powerful Ainsworth Spanish Immersion (ASI) syndicate.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far. The ASI Spanish speakers are mostly rich white Hispanic families, who are now claiming to be part of the historically underserved population. This is an abomination. ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

"You provide an unspecific example of some organization that supposedly doesn't accept a white member but of course you make no mention of the major American institutions that have failed to integrate (continue to practice discrimination) due to the fact that they are dominated by white people and promote their material interests: the American system of education, political institutions, residential areas (and don't claim that Blacks or Latinos desire to live in racially segregated neighborhoods because peer-reviewed research contradicts that claim), employment. 
From the beginning and continuing today, is the dominant white culture that has instituted the division of society based on race.

 1) A 74 yr old crazy, economically illiterate avowed communist who wrote in the 1970s that the country was close to experiencing a nuclear apocalypse or ""death by poison gas."" but it gets better ...He also claimed cervical cancer was caused by women not experiencing enough orgasms and when he launched his campaign in May, he actually blamed the abundance of consumer goods for child hunger.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. (You are rationalizing warnings about anti-gay and female submission) and Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid (that is pretty much your modus operandi).",Confirmation Bias in Attribution of Groupthink,**GROUPTHINK_DENIAL**,Confirmation Bias in Attribution of Groupthink and GROUPTHINK_DENIAL are the qualitative codes extracted from the response.,"1. **CONFIRMATION_BIAS_MISATTRIBUTION_AS_GROUPTHINK_DENIAL**

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

I won't vote any member of Imago Dei.  Do you really think Pastor McKinley is going to change his conservative Baptist ways and reject female submission and embrace equality of gays and heteros?

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike)
and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.

"My point was that as much as you dismiss Springsteen, or think that you should be able to give him input on his songwriting to have his songs better represent fast food workers, a tiny drop of piss dribbled out of him this morning that's more credible than you in the music industry.

Have some goddamn respect. 

The reason you look like such a childish person right now is that you are trying to hand-wave away Springsteen's 40 year career as a well-respected, credible, honest, and down to Earth musician, and the only reasons you've given amount to ""he's white, he's got a bunch of money, he doesn't write song about Subway, and he wears jeans"".

Should we all boycott McDonald's because the name sounds Scottish but they don't serve Scottish food? How about Subway, their food has nothing to do with underground transportation. Does the name Texas Roadhouse offend Texans? See where I'm going with this. It is just too much! If the name bugs you that much, don't eat there, and stay out of it.

I think we should ban those proxy slave owners from--from--well, whatever they need banning from on the off chance GGG-Grandpa held slaves.  Or how about this--since British colonialism in India seems to have struck a chord, is there any chance these folks are storing away some energy for protesting India's home-grown caste system--which still exists, by the way?  Say, here's a thought: I'm sure there's at least one Indian restaurant in Portland.  How about picketing them for the caste system?  Oh, wait--they may not be white.

This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth.

More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot.

"Fredrick, I'm sure that by now you and I are the only ones following this comment thread. I rate all comments as ""sorta ok"" and ""civil"" also.

Anyway, I mustn't have made my point clear. I don't mean to hint that there is a pro Muslim bias. I'm implying that there is a anti Christian bias. It's no secret that Christianity is fair game, the media and contemporary culture carefully walks on egg shells whenever dealing with issues involving other religions. Don't worry, as soon as the more ignorant members (media/Hollywood/academia) of our society realize that Islam is also monotheistic and is as intolerant (theologically speaking) as is Christianity, they will then attack Islam and Muslims also.",Perceived anti-Christian bias and anticipated Islam criticism,Perceived Double Standard,Refined Perceived Double Standard and Anticipated Bias Equalization,"- Perceived Double Standard, with Anticipated Convergence through Increased Understanding

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

"People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.

"The Catholic Church has never needed permission to pick and choose for whom it would perform any ceremony.

That has not changed because the *states* are now required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples.  There is no relationship between the two.  Obergefell does not require any church to do a single damn thing.  And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.

That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white ""anti-abortionists."" But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

"This is 100 percent baloney. People used to homestead in Alaska till around 1973. Many of the old-timers in Palmer got their land with the mineral rights to the land. That is why we have gravel mined in the valley. The Alaska natives have mineral rights to their land. The Alaska native veterans can still homestead. But not the non-native veteran. It's the old divide and conquer. It is the reduction of our rights and opportunity incrementally and slowly. Can you imagine if Massachusetts had as many parks and national set aside lands as Alaska does? It would not exist. I trust every day people to be good managers of their property, until they prove otherwise. UAA owns land in Alaska and manages it. Why can't Joe Citizen own land with mineral rights?

"How wrong art thou?  Let me count the ways:

(1) I'm an 'Ahmed', not a 'Judah'

(2) And you offer yet another example of what my dear friend, returned to his Lord eight years now, once observed--no people make a greater show of their 'humility' than so-called 'Christians'

(3) And none so frequently--and falsely--claim 'persecution'

(4) One who admonishes keeping God's Law while failing to do so is not only a hypocrite, he embraces arrogance--""Anna khairum min'hum; I'm BETTER than him"".  Satan first uttered that blasphemous fallacy before God Himself

(5) I'm a staunch critic of both the Zionist entity and Da'esh (wrongly called 'Islamic State'--there's nothing Islamic about them).  I've denounced the Sa'ud family--their ideological and financial backers--in Minah, Saudi Arabia, and was threatened with death for it.  Can you say the same?

"What's a 'transgender boyfriend'?  How many 'x'-chromosomes?  And may I suggest you take the trouble to actually become informed about the authentic tenets of my faith before presuming to pontificate on it?  That way you can avoid slagging your own arguments.

And the real joke is that I couldn't marry a second wife--and have it certified--in my OWN Masjid ('mosque').  Because the secular government will impose legal sanctions on any qutb ('preacher') who exercised his right to practice our faith as written in our Scripture.

And there is such a thing as 'freedom of association'.  At least for now.  We don't have to marry you in our Masjid, because by our rules at least one of you has to be Muslim.  For starters.

This is a global TV market and American viewership is pathetic compared to the rest of the soccer dominated world where the revenue is generated. This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams.

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing.

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.",Jesus' solution to gun violence: radical personal transformation.,Radical Consequences,Transformative Radicalism: A Call for Personal Sacrifice Addressing Gun Violence,"1.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.  Eddie Vedder joined them onstage and they looked like teenagers up there just enjoying being a part of our night.

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

"Sanders risks looking like a sore loser with this whole superdelegate conversion thing.  And whining about the party registration rules.  They have existed for a long time and while it's great that more people are paying attention to the nitty gritty of politics, trying to change the rules during the primaries is waste of time and distraction from the issues such as women rights.  Those who earn superdelgate status have been going to meetings weekly and monthly for years, not just in the election season and election year.  Concerned, involved citizens deserve this position, and they are there to do what's best for the party and avoid demagogues. Sanders is a recent convert as a Democrat, he's not giving the party any money (unlike Clinton) and should be focusing his supporters' attention on taking back the Senate rather than bashing fellow Democrats. He's not really a progressive since he won't go up against the big gun manufacturers and the NRA – a huge disconnect.","Sanders' Self-Interested, Disconnected Approach Distracts from Issues and Party Unity",Discrediting Sanders' Credentials,"**Code:** **Undermining Sanders' Democratic Legitimacy through Perceived Self-Interest and Policy Inconsistency**

Example, 75 MILLION native Australian marsupials, rodents, birds, reptiles and frogs disappear down feral cat gullets each NIGHT, while  animal rights imbeciles like over-the-hill ""sex symbol"" Bridgette Bardot shriek and flail about Aussies' ""murdering cats.""

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters. I left Anchorage primarily because of the fact that it was hard to get decent (or any) medical care for seniors. The other reason I left was the barbaric treatment of LGBT by the State of Alaska, law enforcement, and the whole GOPtp roster of hateful, pandering political office holders.

"The world is in turmoil because of Mrs. Clinton's incompetence. Her ""extensive"" international experience includes siding with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (One vote, one time), removing Ghaddafi (We came, we saw, he died) with no plan afterwards, turning oil-rich Libya into a hell-hole with thousands fleeing to Europe causing the refugee crisis. Her failure to urge Obama to maintain troops in Iraq allowed ISIS to gain a foothold in the region. Mrs. Clinton also botched her ""re-start"" with Russia, handing the foreign minister a mistranslated ""restart"" button. Russia has resumed its aggressive posture (Ukraine, Crimea), knowing it was amateur hour at the US State Department. And her lies about Benghazi are a disgrace; she was AWOL during the 3 am phone call. Mrs. Clinton is guilty of felonies for storing classified information on a non-secure, non-government server.

"I've just been made aware that the suspects, caught with a vehicle full of $3200 (per owner) worth of goods stolen in a local break-in, just got off with just about no penalties at all.

"So by your argument people convicted should just give up on life, because nobody wants somebody who made a mistake in life? Pretty harsh, with that argument we should just kill everyone ever convicted of a crime because they have no future and it's just wasting time and resources to keep people with no future in jail or out on the streets. I say the streets because if everyone shared your attitude there would be nobody to rehabilitate, no jobs, no new careers. Where do you expect people to go after they do their time in prison?

"Hilarious as always Lizzy ! Thanks for stopping into my beauty studio! I completely agree, ""if you're worried that no one will love you with a full bush, you can stop worrying. Turns out, pubic hair has literally nothing to do with love.""

I often rock a full bush (TMI?) and many of our clients see us for all kinds of stuff (facials & relaxation included). And since I'm the one who spends a good deal of my time sugaring vaginas, I'd like to mention that the majority of my clients say that THEY like it and THEY feel good (regardless of what a partner thinks). And yes - many say that it helps with orgasming (not sure why but I'll take their word for it!)

This is confusing because we were told repeatedly by Ted Cruz’s family that God TOLD him to run and now he’s up and quit.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.

"when I first heard trump would be here, I immediately thought how can I thumb my nose at him.  I want to show him no respect, I think he is evil (entitled to my opinion) and that he as president is a most ridiculous and dangerous proposition.
  and then I realize  - he feeds off that energy...it is fuel to his vile rants..it is an excuse to insult any sub-group of our citizenry that aren't rich old greedy white men like him. to his supporters, he's already demonstrated his dislike for at least 50% of his supporters.. these tough poor working women who support him...if he is willing to slur ver accomplished women, how do you think he's gonna regard you?  unless you're eastern European and about 20 yrs old...won't be pretty.
 so I decided the best thing I can do is not go, not feed his rhetoric, not give him a target to rant at, not let him rile the people.  what if nobody went to protest?  would that not take the wind out of his sails?  what would he say?

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run? There are a number of studies showing correlation between repressed sexual and gender identification and depression and suicide.", Inherent gender identity and impact of repression.,Innate Identity,"**Innate Gender Identity and Harm of Repression**

"a 45-year-old male student, who dresses as a woman and goes by the name Colleen Francis, undressed and exposed his genitals on several occasions inside the woman’s locker room at Evergreen State College.

Students from nearby Olympia High School as well as children at a local swimming club share locker rooms with the college.

According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.

The coach later apologized when she discovered the man was transgendered but explained there were girls using the facility as young as six years old who weren’t used to seeing male genitals.",Comment: Inappropriate exposure in shared locker room by transgender individual.,Exposure vs. Inclusion,Exposure vs. Inclusion in Shared Locker Room Spaces,"1. **Specificity**: Exposure vs. Inclusion in Shared Locker Room Spaces

If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate.

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.

"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals.

Voting rights are still being denied based on spurious suggestions of voter fraud (which is virtually non-existent, except in the fevered minds of Republican operatives).

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains.

"Sorry, Bob, Hillory the Blood Countess PROMISED to ""obliterate"" (her word) the Islamic Republic of Iran--that's 70 million human beings--with tactical nuclear weapons at an appearance before a Dartmouth University crowd just last year (07/03/15).  And she's been singing that same hideous refrain since 2008, when she advocated nuclear immolation of Iran before an AIPAC audience in 2008 when she ran against Obama.

On this question whose word should I accept, Bob, yours or that of the Blood Countess herself?  She'll do whatever it takes to ingratiate herself to the Zionists and the military/industrial profiteers.  Wikileaks has released emails in which she advocates promoting war between Shi'a and Sunni Muslims as ""beneficial to US interests"".  You know better than to let partisan politics ""trump"" (no pun intended) clear issues of right and wrong, Bob.

"How do we know if one of us is a pervert?   Why not assume the guy trucker with naked lady mud flaps isn't a perve?   You're an adult and must have some idea of the crazy and 'unusual' sexual obsessions of heterosexuals.  How do I know that you don't have whips and chains at home and here you are standing next to me at a urinal.  

Your assumption is that gay and transgendered people are perverted.  They can wear a button down 3 piece suite, belong to the local Service Organization, have 'normal' children who fit in nicely with the classmates, and they would still be perverts in your opinion.

Now if that isn't your opinion, I appologize, but you leap to many assumptions about transgendered people with what I guess is no little to no interest in finding out how they came to be transgendered.

I love the teachers there, but forget paying for some stupid sports and buildings, thinking that this will make people want to move to Alaska for college. Nobody moves to Alaska because one of the pros is that we have a new freaking arena. A great education in my interested field of study is why I would move for school. Not to mention the basketball coach obviously doesn't like black people and everyone knows it. These people who make financial decisions should get schooled by us because this is ridiculous.

"Exposure to nudity of the opposite gender in person for a young person unused to it is quite different than exposure on TV, just as exposure to acts of war in person results in PTSD far more than watching realistic depictions of it on TV does.

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them. Those places where restrooms are required will provide a few single user unisex restrooms, resulting in long lines, or restrooms will be pay-to-play like Europe.

"I don't think she can  afford to play nice.  That's a mistake many liberals make, assuming others will naturally agree with them.   'If we treat them kindly, they will love us and be transformed'.  Not in a 60 minute debate, not with Donald Trump.

I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

"I agree all immigrants should be documented as required.  I believe the status of the Parent and Child must be the same, that of the parent.

I understand the masculine vs feminine conflict we have been seeing in the country.   It's hard for some men to adjust to the loss of power where the number of jobs that women hold, has been growing for 40 years.  (Positions that women have earned!).

"Right on! The nimrods who think there's no difference between Trump and Clinton are playing silly ego games without a clue as to how people's lives may be affected in horrific or uplifting ways.
 
Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

Even if these animals were in excess surely it's the responsibility of the parks board to sort it out and not leave it's borders open to hunters to sort out for them because hunters don't know how to discriminate between what needs to be culled vs what needs to be retained.

This is not a new story: as other posters have stated, the role of black soldiers' contributions has already been reported in other publications.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""

"People who refuse to study history are doomed to repeat it. The Nazis were one flavor of socialists and looked how well that turned out. The USSR was communist-flavored socialism and 70 years of bread lines until it collapsed. China avoided socialistic collapse by instituting state ""capitalism"", which is just another form of socialism. European socialism is breaking down. What is wrong with the United States economy is a direct result of Keynsian economics (another form of socialism). At what point do we look at history and say ""Let's not go there""?

"I simply cannot believe this ramping-up of the PC war against the English language and common sense.  Too many people are getting indignant over imaginary slights created only in their own minds.

If the (sensible) word ""Oriental"" is somehow 'offensive' in reference to those from the Orient, then is the word ""European"" offensive in reference to anybody from Europe?  Honestly, where does this insanity and hypocrisy stop?

(And by the way, for those geographically ignorant Americans --- which is most of them --- who for whatever PC reason prefer the word ""Asian"" to ""Oriental"", let me point out that the continent of Asia consists of MANY more lands, and more peoples, than simply those of the Orient.)

One more thing, why are we English speakers supposed to automatically bow to other language groups when using words in OUR language which refer to them, when THEY do not do the same for us?  Again, this artificial but purposely divisive non-issue is simply nonsense and hypocrisy run wild.","

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.  That's the way the Nazis thought.  That's the way the da'esh (""ISIS"") thinks now.

"I suspect someone who is 80 and Black might ask, ""comes to America""? Or someone who lived in Vietnam during the war years and saw hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens killed by American bombs might ask, ""comes to America""?

Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.

"amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject  covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe.",Dismissal of mother's advocacy due to tobacco industry misconceptions,Defensive Tribute,"**Proud Defense Against Misconceptions**

This code captures the essence of the comment, which is a proud and defensive response to criticism of the author's mother's accomplishments, particularly in the context of her work on safety laws and her advice to asthma patients to smoke one cigarette a day as a form of relief. The code conveys the author's emotional tone, which is protective and proud of their mother's legacy, while also being dismissive and critical of those who belittle her achievements due to misunderstandings about her role in the tobacco industry. The refined code also emphasizes the historical context of doctors prescribing cigarettes for asthma patients and the author's emphasis on moderation, not excessive smoking.","**Proud Defense of Mother's Legacy**

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman.

"""a surge that coincided with the election of the first black U.S. president""

Unless the author is accusing these people of racist behavior, why is this statement in the article? The author could have easily used Barack Obama's name instead of his preferred racial identity.

""...Jerad and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian and also died in a Las Vegas shooting rampage.""

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

It appears these people are sensible, support the Constitution and family values, and have the widely held sense to distrust the government as did our founders.

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

"Oh Mark. To explain anything to you would be like knocking on a dead man’s door and be just as fruitless.

In the words of David Bowie...But I’ll try. I’ll try.

My critical comments spoke to your professional incompetence as a publisher, and was not personal. We’ve never met, have we? However, judging from your initial personal attack on me and your subsequent two-dimensional responses, my criticisms proved to have merit.

I could go on and explain that too but …you know, fruitless. You and the Juneau Empire publisher should get together ‘cause you’re like two peas in quite a limited pod. Same lack of comprehension beyond anything complex.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.

"Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.  And they list the Nation of Islam as a racist group that spreads hatred.  And Ali has been a member ever since 1964.  They are an extremist fringe sect of Islam with less than 40,000 members.  

So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam

""The Nation of Islam's theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.""

""The 21 trans people murdered in 2015 listed in the HRC report were recorded as single or multiple bias murders by the FBI.""

Your source? The HRC report makes it clear that they don't know the motive in most of these cases, and complains that too few cases are reported as ""bias-motivated"" crime.

""As far as the man killed in Vermont just a few days ago authorities have yet to determine if his transgender status was a factor. They haven’t expressly said anything except that they were still investigating.""

"There you go, stay the course. It is your hatred/machismo combination that gained you a following by others who hate and appreciate you talking tough and hateful.

The issue here is the whole world is disturbed by Trump's hatred, forget about what the GOP thinks- they have never been concerned what Americans actually think. In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump. The GOP card has been about hate long before Trump- how about: women can't control their own womb, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more coroporation rights than individual rights, problems with what room you go to the bathroom in, who you marry. The racism and hate has always been not far from the GOP, mimicking the traditionally racist south on voting lines. Also no coincidence, it is the vastly undereducated that support the GOP...anyone with an education can see nothing but hate/corporate profiteering and little else.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge. Sadly, looking at the statistics for our legal system's incarceration and execution of black males relative to their rates of committing crimes, a whole lot of our judges don't belong on the bench.","

"No one or  group of people deserved to be targeted and  called names ( pig, rapists, criminals) or insulted ( ""Lying"" Ted, ""Crooked Hillary"", ""Little Marco"" or John McCain is not a real war hero) .  Trump uses insults freely such as ""unattractive, dumb, I am smarter, lightweight, boring, clowns, he's a zero, no talent, a waste."" In fact there are hundreds of people he has done this over his decades in the public eye.   There is no way that Trump would expect for people to not be ""offended"" by his speech because that is why he does it. But as this reporter and Trump will cry ""Free Speech"", it has been ruled on by the courts of this nation that such ""Free Speech"" comes with responsibility.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

In the context of LLM-1's code, this could mean avoiding broad brushed attacks on ignorance or nationalism, and instead focusing on the specific content of Trump's rhetoric and its impact on immigration-related issues.

""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case.

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)???

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

Thankfully McGuire is finished as a legislator and will not be coming back.","The qualitative code for the comment Betrayal of public interest and fiscal irresponsibility could be:

"And the deflection begins again!

Another shooting, this time part of the 3.5% of the population was the target.  So the typical outcry is eliminate guns or eliminate discrimination or more hate crimes laws.  When the real ""cause"" had nothing to do with firearms or discrimination.  The base cause is cultural.  The shooter's culture vs American culture.

Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American.  As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home.  Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act.  ISIS announced an attack 3 days before.  Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic.  These are the storyline so far.

He and his Father were known to the FBI and ""on their radar"" but the FBI couldn't tie them to any terror cell.  Just like the Boston bomber and the San Bernardino shooters.  The FBI was useless or complicit.

"I taught my boys that they have to do the work for themselves AND the girl.  That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.  He would be on the hook for child support if a child were produced and he would be the one responsible if she later cried rape.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings.

"I keep reading that islam is the fastest growing ""religion""(I think political machine might be a more appropriate term) ... & I wonder how that can be. But then people's values, mores, etc. vary widely. Acquisition of power may be part of the motive. Having nothing to loose may be part. Pure, unadulterated hatred for others -even others of one's own culture, seems to be found in muslim radicals.
How many bad people or even lesser jerks, see themselves that way?
But read the koran, see the numerous passages that urge all types of bad treatment of non-muslims, including death. With that book as their  set of guiding principles - how can any sane person not be islamophobic?
Defense of our citizens & freedom is not a vice. Acquiescence to evil is clearly self defeating.", Islamophobia due to perceived radicalism and hostility in Islamic teachings,Islamophobia as Self-Defense,"**Islamophobia through Perceived Threat and Self-Defense**

This code acknowledges the perceived threats and radicalism in Islamic teachings as a primary motivator for Islamophobia. It also incorporates the idea that some individuals view their skepticism and fear towards Islam as a rational response to these perceived threats. Additionally, it suggests that the concept of self-defense plays a role in justifying and reinforcing Islamophobic attitudes.

The refined code maintains the core aspects of both initial codes, but emphasizes the complexity of the issue by presenting it as a dynamic interaction between perceived threats and the self-perceived rationalization of fear and mistrust.","Islamophobia driven by Perceived Religious and Cultural Threats, Reinforced by Skepticism and Self-Defense Rationalizations","Both codes proposed by LLM-1 and LLM-2 capture the essence of the initial comment and acknowledge the role of perceived threats, radicalism, and self-defense rationalizations in shaping Islamophobia. Here are some refinements that can be made to further improve the codes:

LLM-1: Islamophobia through Perceived Threat, Radicalism, and Self-Defense Rationalizations

* Incorporate the term radicalism to highlight the specific aspects of Islamic teachings that are being referred to.
* Add rationalizations to emphasize the way in which the perceived threats, radicalism, and self-defense motivations are used as justifications for Islamophobia.

LLM-2: Islamophobia driven by Perceived Religious, Cultural, and Security Threats, Reinforced by Skepticism and Self-Defense Rationalizations

* Be more specific by including religious, cultural, and security threats.
* Add reinforced to capture the ongoing and cyclical nature of the factors that contribute to Islamophobia.

By incorporating these refinements, the codes will concisely and accurately represent the themes present in the original comment while providing a robust foundation for further analysis.","1. Clarify the role of radicalism

What we need is a plan of action to deal with the mentally ill because the current approach is simply not working.  You seem to think that all we need to do is give them medication, home and a job.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again. And they will.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"I think you should mind your own business.  I'm sick of men telling women how they should behave in your eyes.  I think of the movie INDEPENDENCE DAY w/Will Smith.  The First Lady is lady injured and is being cared for from Will's love.  The FL asks ""what do you do for a living'?  ""I'm a dancer"".  FL:  Oh?  A Ballerina?  No, A stripper.  FL is a little ashamed and the young woman says ""Why?  I earn honest money and I take good care of my son"".

"And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color.

"Everyone is aware Trump has the right to say things such as of a female journalist, ""there was blood coming out of her wherever"" or his reference to Clinton's visit to the restroom during the debates as ""too disgusting"" or when he said about Latinos ""they're rapists,"" they are simply questioning his judgement and fitness for the highest office in the nation due to his willingness to defame and denigrate entire groups of his fellow citizens based on their ethnicity, religion or sex for the purpose of gaining votes.

This refined code maintains the core elements of the original code while making a few adjustments for improved clarity and concision. It:

1. Reorders the words to prioritize the main action (Critique of Trump's Public Office Suitability) and then lists the key reasons for this critique (Denigration, Divisive Rhetoric, and Hate Speech).
2. Includes Hate Speech explicitly, which was a key element in my initial code (Questioning Trump's Fitness via Critique of Hate Speech).

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?

"“You don’t need no gun control, you know what you need? We need some bullet control. Men, we need to control the bullets, that’s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

So even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out.

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms. What does it say about a civilized society that we would have to bleep a statement from the leading Republican candidate because he was being ""truthful""?

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives. Statistics and facts. Just like when you say that black on black crime is what kills the most you are called a racist.

Now Loretta Lynch claims she does not know where the wife who helped the shooter is, so does that also include the FBI?""

Another shooting, by a muslim declaring terrorist associations.  Blame the gun.
Another theft, burglary, robbery, murder, etc.  Blame drugs, blame society, blame anything except the person who commits the crime!  

Many of these crimes are by repeat offenders or those on a 'watchlist' of known gang members, drug dealers.  Just what good is a watchlist anyway?  Does it really help the investigation after the crime is committed?  Are all of those who law enforcement have been watching pulled in for questioning?  

Flash:  Crimes are committed by people!  People who have been ""raised"" with no respect for others, who know the punishment and have no fear of it!  People raised in a system where 'criminal' rights are more important than the victims.  I for one am tired of it.

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel.

"A new definition of irony, hypocrisy, hidden agenda resulting in total lack of credibility and revealing a cluelessness rarely seen at the executive level:

This muslim radical terrorist ""self identifies"" on facebook, phone calls, texting etc as such and tbe Administration / AG now redact and inexplicably try to dilute the hard facts-just like Beghazi et al.  Fact.  

The same Admin wants transgender rights for those that ""self identify"" as another sex and decry those questioning the slippery slope as bigots.  Fact.  

So what's in a phrase?  Hmm.  

The gay community is admirably and  understandably proactive in defending themselves-much like Israel on the world stage.

"First, there can be no comparison between sexual assault and someone getting rolled at a party. None. That being said...

Just so I’m clear, if you’re incapacitated you deserve, on some level, to be robbed “or worse”. You’ve gone to this party, where I’m guessing you were among people you knew and trusted, got wasted, and we’re insert crime here, and it’s your fault.

This has nothing going to do with a “culture of victimhood,” whatever that means, and everything to do with the attempt to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim. The fact is, he’s wrong, as are you. Women, regardless of how their dressed, what they’ve drank, who they’ve previously had relations with, what part of town they happen to be in, or any other qualifier that used to be, and sadly still is, used, are never responsible for the crimes committed against them.

Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.

"So, a couple of questions. While you're spreading the ""truth"" are you quoting those popular verses in Leviticus? The clobber verses?
Speaking of Leviticus, are you wearing blended fibers? According to that book of the Bible, it's an abomination. 
While you're here in Alaska, have you enjoyed our excellent, varied crab dishes? Scallops? Clams? Shrimp? Oops, that too is an abomination.
This might be a wee bit indelicate, but has any female member of your household stayed under your roof while they're menstruating? Yup, abomination.
If you have children, have they ever disobeyed you? Did you kill them? That is what Leviticus calls for.
Have you ever eaten pork? Touched a pig or anything made from a pig? Abomination.
I see you're clean shaven and have cut the hair from around your temples. Oh boy. You really like to rebel don't you?
Do you have a garden? I sure hope you have different gardens for each plant, otherwise, abomination.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

"The only racism I've been seeing is baseless accusations and chips on the shoulders of black transplants obviously uncomfortable in a town full of white people and probably wondering why so few of us want to pal around with them. It's a cultural thing, really; I just don't dig it, same as I didn't dig the crusty old mutant conservative villagers in Switzerland when I lived there. Same as you probably wouldn't dig the company of Amish farmers.

The native Portland white is for the most part a mellow guy who doesn't like confrontation or violence and feels uncomfortable, even disgusted, by garish displays of macho posturing. Knowing that what we regard as civility is considered “pussy” by African Americans who come here with Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes simply adds insult to injury. Maybe if you'd holster your iron and let us get to know you and not the strutting rooster you'd be pleasantly surprised at how accepting we are.",Perceived Cultural Clash and Mutual Discomfort in Portland,**Cultural Defensiveness**,"**Cultural Misunderstanding and Defensiveness**

This code combines the elements from both codes, emphasizing the speaker's perception of cultural differences that lead to mutual misunderstanding and the defensive tone adopted by the speaker towards the black transplants and African Americans. The code not only reflects the cultural disconnect but also the speaker's judgments and assumptions about the Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes and the criticism of the black transplants' behavior, characterized as garish displays of macho posturing and strutting rooster.

The refined code emphasizes the speaker's role in perpetuating the cultural confrontation by using negative perceptions, stereotypes, and blame-shifting, instead of acknowledging the potential for deeper understanding and inclusivity.

2. **Distinguishing between intent and impact**: While the speaker may not intend to be overtly racist, their words and stereotypes can still have harmful impacts on the groups they are describing. Acknowledge both the speaker's intent and the potential consequences of their words.

3. **Examining cultural gatekeeping**: Consider the role of cultural gatekeeping in the speaker's defensive tone. Cultural gatekeeping refers to the ways in which established group members may control access to resources, social networks, and acceptance, often leading to the exclusion of newcomers or those with different backgrounds.

Definition:
This code represents instances where speakers express conflicting cultural attitudes, often employing a defensive tone, thereby perpetuating stereotypes and prejudices. The refined code acknowledges and contextualizes power dynamics, systemic inequalities, and intersectionality and introduces subcodes for detailed analysis. These subcodes include:

1. Defensive Tone: Identifying moments where speakers use a defensive tone, language, or rhetoric to protect their cultural values or beliefs, or to deflect criticism.
2. Stereotyping and Prejudice: Recognizing the use of stereotypes and prejudicial statements that reduce the complexity of a cultural group or individual to essentialized or oversimplified characteristics.
3. Lack of Inclusivity: Highlighting instances where speakers exclude, marginalize, or ignore diverse perspectives or cultural experiences.
4. Cultural Essentialism: Noting moments when speakers emphasize a rigid or idealized view of a culture while neglecting its complexity or diversity.
5. Power Dynamics: Examining the ways cultural misunderstandings are shaped by and contribute to power dynamics in social, political, and institutional contexts.
6. Intent vs. Impact: Distinguishing the intended meaning from the actual consequences of speakers' words, actions, or beliefs.
7. Cultural Gatekeeping: Analyzing practices or attitudes that reinforce cultural boundaries, control membership, or limit access to cultural resources.

Description:
The refined code Cultural Misunderstanding and Power Dynamics offers a nuanced and detailed analysis of speakers' perspectives and broader contexts.

Did you read the story I linked to carefully? It is disturbing to say the least.  

I see in Trump a psychopath who will say anything to get elected.   I feel so creeped out by this election, and wish that the Republican nominee was someone not-a-rapist.   I am not a fan of Rubio, but he is sane & not a sex offender.  Have you thought about the libertarian candidate?

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.  

Some high-ranking defectors aside, the Republicans will rally behind Trump because it's all they can do.  He is likely to lose, after which they will blame him, not themselves.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

The best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.","Hypocritical business practices: Hobby Lobby claims to uphold Christian values, yet conducts commercial activities on Sundays through online sales and employing staff, deemed as hypocritical and deserving of consumer boycott.",Hypocrisy,Hypocritical Business Practices,"- Hypocrisy in Business Operations

"No matter the eventual reasoning that may come to light, I won't believe it. Some people simply want to hurt, and destroy, and kill, and will convince themselves of whatever they need in order to feel justified. Black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by the police than I, and though there are many reasons for the discrepancy the fact remains that's a horrific statistic that needs to be dealt with. However there's no way you're going to convince me that shooting a bunch of random family men in the back is any way forwards.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else.

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

Of course, if you are talking about all categories of shootings and talking about Chicago, then I stand corrected. BLM say that they are non violent and just want to have an honest dialogue and get the problems out in the open so that they can be solved. Then how about addressing the dishonest statistics they cite, how about addressing the way that young blacks respond to any question by a police officer or request by an officer?

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM.

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
