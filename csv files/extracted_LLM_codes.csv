"People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.
People hate, God does not. I respect the freedom of religion until it tramples on the freedom of others.

"The Catholic Church has never needed permission to pick and choose for whom it would perform any ceremony.

That has not changed because the *states* are now required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples.  There is no relationship between the two.  Obergefell does not require any church to do a single damn thing.  And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out. 

The Catholics used to be focused on things like orphanages and priceless artifacts and poisoning each other at the Vatican.  They should stick to that, and stop trying to gin up more false grist for the propaganda machine that is rapidly destroying our democracy and turning the U.S. into ungovernable factions where every problem has to be solved in federal court.

"read the link - ridiculous.  cultural appropriation - yes.  but the culture it represents is not just black, it represent a lot of the precepts of Rastafari practices which is a philosophy and a religion - they believe the bible says to not cut one's hair, Hasidic jews also have locks down the sides of their head based on the same interpretation.  you could make the argument that the american  black population ""borrowed"" the style from the Jamaicans...at first being a statement of being mellow and in solidarity to the use of pot.... as did the white population at the same time, to make the same statement..

"Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.

Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.

And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.

I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.  Or another of the remains of a little girl in Fallujah who died screaming as she dissolved in a toxic, super-heated cloud of white phosphorus.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”

That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white ""anti-abortionists."" But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams.

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex.

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago?

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.

Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.

There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.

"Immersion schools are far from immune to racism. I think Mr. Cramer said the Third World War exercise was the extreme example, but overall he suggested that everyday racist logic and assumptions on the part of white people were more common and therefore the more problematic. 
Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism. Or better yet, they could simply teach kids about the history of white racism in the United States starting in fourth or fifth grade and throughout high school.",Education on systemic racism in immersion schools and curriculum,Racial Awareness Education,Educational Interventions to Combat Systemic Racism Through Racial Literacy for White Individuals,"1.

"What a shameful way to treat this man. And what a waste of a man's great capabilities. All because some bigot named Boyko found personal pleasure in attacking this good person. I don't know how Boyko can even look at his own face in a mirror. The reflection of a heinous monster staring back at him should be enough to cause him to change his ugly soul. But apparently it isn't. But you know, for every ugly person out there like Boyko, there's more of us who aren't like him. I support my LGBT community members and will always stand up and vote to protect them from unfair practices. It's taking a long time to get where we need to be, but it WILL eventually happen. People are starting to see the light. And one thing we can count on is that eventually all the old bastards that are currently being jerks will die off. And maybe that will make room for more people who can actually affect change. Good luck to Judge Carlson and his husband. I just hope the best comes their way.

We've erased the ancient line that was drawn between right and wrong in regards to marriage, and put ourselves on a terrible trajectory.  I don't believe most advocates of homosexual marriage intend or see the path they've put us on. But the sky's the limit now; the wall has been torn down. Eventually marriage between adults and children (already okay in some backwards portions of the world) will be acceptable in our society, as well as between children and other children.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

Most of you people have no clue what goes on in these camps. You all holler lack of housing. Well most campers if you talk to them are heroin addicts. You never see any kids or families. Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison..

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

"DB - How do you respond to these:
     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

He has been sexually unfaithful to her, having sex with a prostitute.    Is there any chance that he might catch a venereal disease, and pass it on to her?

He not only stole money from the family business, but he has practically single-handedly destroyed that business that the family relies on to survive.

I find Trump protester's behavior to be usually worse than the behavior or words that they claim to have a issue with. But most are either partisan voters who would probably never vote for the guy no matter how he acted, or they lack intellectual honesty along with common courtesy.

When you protest against someone who in all reality only happens to have a different point of view than you it makes you appear to anyone who is rational that your just another self absorbed douchebag. People who think protesters deserve to be shot tend to be viewed in the same light as well.","Partisan, intellectually dishonest, self-absorbed actions vs. constitutional protection.",Free Speech vs. Intolerance,Free Speech Protections vs. Problematic Protest Behavior,**Refined Code:** Free Speech Protections vs. Intolerant Protest Behavior,Free Speech Protections vs. Intolerant Protest Behavior,Free Speech Protections vs. Problematic Protest Behavior,Free Speech Protections vs. Problematic Protest Behavior,"- LLM-1: Free Speech Protections vs. Intolerant Protest Behavior

"I swear Jeff King kills me, as if the NBA and the NFL haven't suspended players for domestic violence?  Whether you like it or not, we live in a public global world, and when you do stupid things in life those things can impact more than just your legal ability to navigate through the world.

Stupid choices can impact, your job, your credit, your ability to have a promising career, where you live, hell your behavior can even impact your friendships.  Under a global eyeglass where literally everyone is watching, the mistakes you make are no longer simply brushed under a rug.  So you might want to tidy up those skeletons Jeff.

Also I'm just going to be honest, a convict is a convict, I don't care if he pleas down to a lesser charge.

"How could there be a stigma attached to something that is private--who would know if someone uses birth control other than the people involved. Only in an idiotic society like America would such ideas as ""only nice girls get pregnant, others use birth control"" prevail. If one is sexually active one needs to find as reliable a method of birth control as possible in order to reduce recourse to abortion which is inconvenient. In most other countries that can be compared with the US, such ideas as those expressed by Dejain would be considered a sign of a intellectual deficiency or lack of education. Religious sentiment still runs deep here in backwards America.","The qualitative code extracted from the comment is: Deeply rooted religious influence perpetuating birth control stigma in uneducated, backwards US society.",Societal Stigma vs. Reproductive Autonomy,**Code:** Societal Stigma and Cultural Perceptions of Birth Control,"1.

"Where do you live? I'll bet it's in a hazard zone that has been buffered up for your suburban lifestyle. 

Once again for the people who can't be bothered to read, the residents of Kiv didn't ""decide"" to settle there, they were forced to settle there by the white people who invaded and seized their lands and destroyed their way of life. So, perhaps it's the white people who should fix this problem. I say stop dumping money into garbage cities like Anchorage and Wasilla and start paying to help smaller communities.

"So by your argument people convicted should just give up on life, because nobody wants somebody who made a mistake in life? Pretty harsh, with that argument we should just kill everyone ever convicted of a crime because they have no future and it's just wasting time and resources to keep people with no future in jail or out on the streets.

"Hilarious as always Lizzy ! Thanks for stopping into my beauty studio! I completely agree, ""if you're worried that no one will love you with a full bush, you can stop worrying. Turns out, pubic hair has literally nothing to do with love.""

I often rock a full bush (TMI?) and many of our clients see us for all kinds of stuff (facials & relaxation included). And since I'm the one who spends a good deal of my time sugaring vaginas, I'd like to mention that the majority of my clients say that THEY like it and THEY feel good (regardless of what a partner thinks). And yes - many say that it helps with orgasming (not sure why but I'll take their word for it!)

"Holy smokes!

This is confusing because we were told repeatedly by Ted Cruz’s family that God TOLD him to run and now he’s up and quit. I’m no theologian but it seems to me that folks who disobey direct orders from God never come to a good ending. There very well could be some smiting in Ted’s not-so-distant future. All I can say is that I wouldn’t want to stand too near him in a thunder storm.

Anywho… More importantly to America, where does the Christianist vote go now?? Surely not to Donald Trump, who has already extolled the virtues of Planned Parenthood and a desire to not kill off all The Gays. It’s a bit of a conundrum.","```plaintext
