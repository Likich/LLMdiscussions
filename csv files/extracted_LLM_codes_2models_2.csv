"People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.
People hate, God does not. I respect the freedom of religion until it tramples on the freedom of others. If they weren't doing anything wrong, there'd be no need for suing or prosecuting.",**Religious-based discrimination vs. love and inclusion**,Respect Boundaries,"**Respectful Inclusion**

"The Catholic Church has never needed permission to pick and choose for whom it would perform any ceremony.

That has not changed because the *states* are now required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples.  There is no relationship between the two.  Obergefell does not require any church to do a single damn thing.  And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out. 

The Catholics used to be focused on things like orphanages and priceless artifacts and poisoning each other at the Vatican.  They should stick to that, and stop trying to gin up more false grist for the propaganda machine that is rapidly destroying our democracy and turning the U.S. into ungovernable factions where every problem has to be solved in federal court.

"read the link - ridiculous.  cultural appropriation - yes.  but the culture it represents is not just black, it represent a lot of the precepts of Rastafari practices which is a philosophy and a religion - they believe the bible says to not cut one's hair, Hasidic jews also have locks down the sides of their head based on the same interpretation.  you could make the argument that the american  black population ""borrowed"" the style from the Jamaicans...at first being a statement of being mellow and in solidarity to the use of pot.... as did the white population at the same time, to make the same statement..

"Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.

Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.

And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”

That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white ""anti-abortionists."" But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

"You're changing the subject. Surprisingly Junior had a valid point. The real gripe of these women is they are horrid negotiators.

This is a global TV market and American viewership is pathetic compared to the rest of the soccer dominated world where the revenue is generated. This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams.

In this thread, observe the common rhetorical conservative ""tactic"" of 1) making a race-baiting comment; 2) when called out for said race-baiting comment, trying to turn the tables to say ""you're really the racist! You brought race into this!"" These people who do this are unable to help themselves; they were raised on a steady diet of resentment  and think poking fun at the physical characteristics and ancestry of other people is the height of wit. 

They know they're being left behind by a world that finds them as distasteful and ignorant as the people who threw rocks at little black girls getting off school buses in the 50s.  Unable to adjust, they resent those who did. So they vent here. The dogs bark but the caravans move on.","```plaintext

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  

It's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female.

Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.  Eddie Vedder joined them onstage and they looked like teenagers up there just enjoying being a part of our night.  Bruce is a throwback who still has a lot to offer those willing to truly listen.","- Appreciation for Authentic Rocker

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"Thomas Morse:  It's not always nature that people have different needs for like sexual partners.  Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.  The Bible says it's an abomination for a man to lay with another man in the way of a woman.  There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

"Immersion schools are far from immune to racism. I think Mr. Cramer said the Third World War exercise was the extreme example, but overall he suggested that everyday racist logic and assumptions on the part of white people were more common and therefore the more problematic. 
Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism. Or better yet, they could simply teach kids about the history of white racism in the United States starting in fourth or fifth grade and throughout high school.",Educating about Anglo-European racism in immersion schools,Racism Awareness through Education,"1.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

"You can't refute my arguments so you indulge in personal attacks by implying I'm a coward.  I've received too many death threats in my lifetime to take that seriously.

See my first reply to you: one of the reasons I oppose these idiots is the harm they do to the environment through their irresponsible 'no-kill' advocacy.  Nor are my activities restricted to Alaska.

Example, 75 MILLION native Australian marsupials, rodents, birds, reptiles and frogs disappear down feral cat gullets each NIGHT, while  animal rights imbeciles like over-the-hill ""sex symbol"" Bridgette Bardot shriek and flail about Aussies' ""murdering cats.""

Sorry, I want my Australian granddaughters to see king parrots, blue-tongued lizards, kookaburras, wallabies, children's pythons, echidnas, White's tree frogs and numbats somewhere other than in a picture-book of extinct Australian animals.  And I would prefer they not have to struggle to survive amidst ecological collapse or cat-vectored  pandemics.

Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison.. So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news.

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

""Refusing to associate"" is different from discriminating.  Religious people don't have the right to use their religion as an excuse to harm others who only want to do business with them.

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

"Great point, so how does a business owner tell if someone is ""gay"" and refuses to bake that cake for their wedding. I am an outdoor hetro female who dresses in jeans and fleece. I have a deep voice, in fact on the phone I get a lot of  "" yes sirs"" from strangers.  I want a cake for my 4o the wedding anniversary and I go to the bakery and only based on ""profiling"" me since I  ""could"" be ""gay"" they can refuse to bake me a cake . If one goes into a business and does no know it does for religious reasons not serve ""gays"" is there to be a test to see if a customer is ""gay"" or not?

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters. I left Anchorage primarily because of the fact that it was hard to get decent (or any) medical care for seniors. The other reason I left was the barbaric treatment of LGBT by the State of Alaska, law enforcement, and the whole GOPtp roster of hateful, pandering political office holders.

"I've just been made aware that the suspects, caught with a vehicle full of $3200 (per owner) worth of goods stolen in a local break-in, just got off with just about no penalties at all. This is part of a family with multiple convictions over the generations. However, the impounded vehicle (with the stolen goods inside) was released from impound to someone using a false address. The owner will never see his stuff again. The break-in artists are free to steal again.

"Hilarious as always Lizzy ! Thanks for stopping into my beauty studio! I completely agree, ""if you're worried that no one will love you with a full bush, you can stop worrying. Turns out, pubic hair has literally nothing to do with love.""

I often rock a full bush (TMI?) and many of our clients see us for all kinds of stuff (facials & relaxation included). And since I'm the one who spends a good deal of my time sugaring vaginas, I'd like to mention that the majority of my clients say that THEY like it and THEY feel good (regardless of what a partner thinks). And yes - many say that it helps with orgasming (not sure why but I'll take their word for it!)

And just to be clear (since your Twitter follower wasn't), we don't imply that one must get vagina hair removed to be a ""portland girl"".",Affirming body positivity and personal choice in female grooming.,Body Positivity,Affirming Body Positivity & Personal Choice in Pubic Hair Grooming,"1.

"Holy smokes!

This is confusing because we were told repeatedly by Ted Cruz’s family that God TOLD him to run and now he’s up and quit. I’m no theologian but it seems to me that folks who disobey direct orders from God never come to a good ending. There very well could be some smiting in Ted’s not-so-distant future. All I can say is that I wouldn’t want to stand too near him in a thunder storm.

Anywho… More importantly to America, where does the Christianist vote go now?? Surely not to Donald Trump, who has already extolled the virtues of Planned Parenthood and a desire to not kill off all The Gays. It’s a bit of a conundrum.",Inconsistency in Christianist voting behavior due to perceived divine disobedience by political figure.,"- Questioning Divine Guidance
