"Everyone is aware Trump has the right to say things such as of a female journalist, ""there was blood coming out of her wherever"" or his reference to Clinton's visit to the restroom during the debates as ""too disgusting"" or when he said about Latinos ""they're rapists,"" they are simply questioning his judgement and fitness for the highest office in the nation due to his willingness to defame and denigrate entire groups of his fellow citizens based on their ethnicity, religion or sex for the purpose of gaining votes. 
There are de jure and de facto limits to free speech: you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater without risking arrest and you can't call someone ""nigg*r"" or ""c*unt"" without risking injury in many cases. Trump won't be arrested of course, he'll just be put out to some pasture where hideous, old, shriveled, small-handed tycoons belong. He's promised not to show his face again after losing. For the good of the country, let's hold him to that.",Denigration and divisive rhetoric,Questioning Trump's Fitness via Critique of Hate Speech,**Challenging Trump's Fitness for Public Office Based on Denigration and Divisive Rhetoric**,"**Critique of Trump's Public Office Suitability: Denigration, Divisive Rhetoric, and Hate Speech**

This refined code maintains the core elements of the original code while making a few adjustments for improved clarity and concision. It:

1. Reorders the words to prioritize the main action (Critique of Trump's Public Office Suitability) and then lists the key reasons for this critique (Denigration, Divisive Rhetoric, and Hate Speech).
2. Includes Hate Speech explicitly, which was a key element in my initial code (Questioning Trump's Fitness via Critique of Hate Speech). This ensures that the refined code fully captures the essence of the comment, which not only criticizes Trump's denigration and divisive rhetoric but also specifically mentions hate speech.
3. Uses a colon (:) to separate the main action from the reasons, improving readability and making the code easier to understand.

This refinement aims to create a code that is both comprehensive and concise, effectively summarizing the comment's critique of Donald Trump's language and behavior in relation to his suitability for public office.","Challenging Trump's Public Office Suitability due to Hate Speech, Denigration, and Divisive Rhetoric",**Challenging Trump's Public Office Suitability due to Hate Speech and Divisive Rhetoric**,"LLM-1: Critiquing Trump's Suitability for the Presidency due to Hate Speech, Denigration, and Divisive Rhetoric

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?

"This is literally one of the most offensive pieces of writing I've seen in a really long time. 
Beyond the absolute garbage about women ""making"" men have sexual thoughts with their clothing and men being essentially violence driven beings, the idea that pre-marital sex being more commen means that consent is assumed is insane. 

""she created the enhanced risk in the first place since in an age of more casual sex, the male is assuming consent.""

Ummmm.....just NO. There is no situation where consent for sex is assumed because you went in a room.

"“You don’t need no gun control, you know what you need? We need some bullet control. Men, we need to control the bullets, that’s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

So even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out.

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms. What does it say about a civilized society that we would have to bleep a statement from the leading Republican candidate because he was being ""truthful""?
For example, ""shit"" ""ass"" ""schlonged"" ""fuck"" ""bullshit"" ""fat ass"" ""bastard"" ""crap"" and ""motherfuckers"".

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives.

Another shooting, by a muslim declaring terrorist associations.  Blame the gun.

Many of these crimes are by repeat offenders or those on a 'watchlist' of known gang members, drug dealers.  Just what good is a watchlist anyway?  Does it really help the investigation after the crime is committed?  Are all of those who law enforcement have been watching pulled in for questioning?

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted.

"A new definition of irony, hypocrisy, hidden agenda resulting in total lack of credibility and revealing a cluelessness rarely seen at the executive level:

This muslim radical terrorist ""self identifies"" on facebook, phone calls, texting etc as such and tbe Administration / AG now redact and inexplicably try to dilute the hard facts-just like Beghazi et al.  Fact.  

The same Admin wants transgender rights for those that ""self identify"" as another sex and decry those questioning the slippery slope as bigots.  Fact.  

So what's in a phrase?  Hmm.  

The gay community is admirably and  understandably proactive in defending themselves-much like Israel on the world stage.

"First, there can be no comparison between sexual assault and someone getting rolled at a party. None. That being said...

Just so I’m clear, if you’re incapacitated you deserve, on some level, to be robbed “or worse”. You’ve gone to this party, where I’m guessing you were among people you knew and trusted, got wasted, and we’re insert crime here, and it’s your fault.

This has nothing going to do with a “culture of victimhood,” whatever that means, and everything to do with the attempt to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim. The fact is, he’s wrong, as are you. Women, regardless of how their dressed, what they’ve drank, who they’ve previously had relations with, what part of town they happen to be in, or any other qualifier that used to be, and sadly still is, used, are never responsible for the crimes committed against them.

"Evangelicals ""panting desire for affirmation""---oh, Donny, oh, yes, yes, arrest those women ""bleeding out of their whatever""--which Trump is all too delighted to quench--does originate in their feelings of inferiority, feelings that have been successfully exploited for decades. Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.

"Ongtooguk nailed the most pervasive, inflammatory part of the gun-grabber 'debate': out of one side of their mouths, they wail, 'we must have new restrictions only to help save our children' , while out of the other they espouse that total confiscation is their ultimate goal, the outright disarming of every citizen, with only the military and police being armed. 

I'm sure that worked great for the Jewish people being rounded up for a trip to Auschwitz. Thanks, but I'm not taking that ride. The Second Amendment has been certified by the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Deal with it.

When the gun-control lobbyists can't discuss the facts, can't get past the 'Scary Assault Rifle' balderdash, continue to press for more restrictions with less enforcement of the restrictions we *already have*, and instantly knee-jerk react to any gun-owner who doesn't  agree with them as a lunatic whackjob looking for defenseless people to murder, where can a reasonable discussion begin?",The qualitative code for the comment could be: Hypocrisy in advocacy and Resistance to discourse.,HypocrisyAndManipulation,**HypocriticalManipulationAndResistanceToOverreach**,"- **HypocrisyAndOverreach**

"So, a couple of questions. While you're spreading the ""truth"" are you quoting those popular verses in Leviticus? The clobber verses?
Speaking of Leviticus, are you wearing blended fibers? According to that book of the Bible, it's an abomination. 
While you're here in Alaska, have you enjoyed our excellent, varied crab dishes? Scallops? Clams? Shrimp? Oops, that too is an abomination.
This might be a wee bit indelicate, but has any female member of your household stayed under your roof while they're menstruating? Yup, abomination.
If you have children, have they ever disobeyed you? Did you kill them? That is what Leviticus calls for.
Have you ever eaten pork? Touched a pig or anything made from a pig? Abomination.
I see you're clean shaven and have cut the hair from around your temples. Oh boy. You really like to rebel don't you?
Do you have a garden? I sure hope you have different gardens for each plant, otherwise, abomination.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

"The only racism I've been seeing is baseless accusations and chips on the shoulders of black transplants obviously uncomfortable in a town full of white people and probably wondering why so few of us want to pal around with them. It's a cultural thing, really; I just don't dig it, same as I didn't dig the crusty old mutant conservative villagers in Switzerland when I lived there. Same as you probably wouldn't dig the company of Amish farmers.

The native Portland white is for the most part a mellow guy who doesn't like confrontation or violence and feels uncomfortable, even disgusted, by garish displays of macho posturing. Knowing that what we regard as civility is considered “pussy” by African Americans who come here with Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes simply adds insult to injury. Maybe if you'd holster your iron and let us get to know you and not the strutting rooster you'd be pleasantly surprised at how accepting we are.",Perceived Cultural Clash and Mutual Discomfort in Portland,**Cultural Defensiveness**,"**Cultural Misunderstanding and Defensiveness**

This code combines the elements from both codes, emphasizing the speaker's perception of cultural differences that lead to mutual misunderstanding and the defensive tone adopted by the speaker towards the black transplants and African Americans. The code not only reflects the cultural disconnect but also the speaker's judgments and assumptions about the Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes and the criticism of the black transplants' behavior, characterized as garish displays of macho posturing and strutting rooster.

The refined code emphasizes the speaker's role in perpetuating the cultural confrontation by using negative perceptions, stereotypes, and blame-shifting, instead of acknowledging the potential for deeper understanding and inclusivity.

2. **Distinguishing between intent and impact**: While the speaker may not intend to be overtly racist, their words and stereotypes can still have harmful impacts on the groups they are describing. Acknowledge both the speaker's intent and the potential consequences of their words.

3. **Examining cultural gatekeeping**: Consider the role of cultural gatekeeping in the speaker's defensive tone. Cultural gatekeeping refers to the ways in which established group members may control access to resources, social networks, and acceptance, often leading to the exclusion of newcomers or those with different backgrounds.

Definition:
This code represents instances where speakers express conflicting cultural attitudes, often employing a defensive tone, thereby perpetuating stereotypes and prejudices. The refined code acknowledges and contextualizes power dynamics, systemic inequalities, and intersectionality and introduces subcodes for detailed analysis. These subcodes include:

1. Defensive Tone: Identifying moments where speakers use a defensive tone, language, or rhetoric to protect their cultural values or beliefs, or to deflect criticism.
2. Stereotyping and Prejudice: Recognizing the use of stereotypes and prejudicial statements that reduce the complexity of a cultural group or individual to essentialized or oversimplified characteristics.
3. Lack of Inclusivity: Highlighting instances where speakers exclude, marginalize, or ignore diverse perspectives or cultural experiences.
4. Cultural Essentialism: Noting moments when speakers emphasize a rigid or idealized view of a culture while neglecting its complexity or diversity.
5. Power Dynamics: Examining the ways cultural misunderstandings are shaped by and contribute to power dynamics in social, political, and institutional contexts.
6. Intent vs. Impact: Distinguishing the intended meaning from the actual consequences of speakers' words, actions, or beliefs.
7. Cultural Gatekeeping: Analyzing practices or attitudes that reinforce cultural boundaries, control membership, or limit access to cultural resources.

Description:

"Bravo ! Excellent assessment of the situation .  The only thing missing is showing how Walker is so obsessed with the gas line , and has been for many years , his judgement is clouded.

Walker claims the state can't survive without our PFD yet months ago he wrote a check to Canada for 65 million . Now he wants to put us on the hook for billions for this gas line pie in the sky that doesn't pencil out.      The fact of the matter is all the polling showed Walker would lose again in the primary to Parnell---that's why he turned independent. The polling showed the democrats had zero chance of winning---that's why they quit .   Simply put---Alaskan's didn't want Walker .

I see in Trump a psychopath who will say anything to get elected.   I feel so creeped out by this election, and wish that the Republican nominee was someone not-a-rapist.   I am not a fan of Rubio, but he is sane & not a sex offender.  Have you thought about the libertarian candidate?

"Your white-washing of the details of the article is disturbing, Outsider77.

Trump is merely an updated version of his father.

The refined code also includes the idea that being white and wealthy can provide a sense of immunity or protection, and that racist attitudes and behaviors can be perpetuated through language and actions, even if not explicitly intended.

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.

"On the first point I disagree. Many well known GOP names are saying trump is a disgrace. Even Ryan, is biting his tongue and drawing blood and he's about as conservative as they come.
I'm sure your right about some teachers, plumbers, clergy, etc., that stereotype and say silly things like 'all white people are racists' while there are just as many saying the same things about any other color or ethnicity. It's true that some will use it as cover to point a finger while engaging in their own bigotry saying 'well, at least I'm not as bad as x'.
I have no idea who's on the top of the domestic terror list. Would it be white males age 18-35? Why is that? They get crappy insurance rates, must be a reason there as well.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

The best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.","Hypocritical business practices: Hobby Lobby claims to uphold Christian values, yet conducts commercial activities on Sundays through online sales and employing staff, deemed as hypocritical and deserving of consumer boycott.",Hypocrisy,Hypocritical Business Practices,"- Hypocrisy in Business Operations

Anyone in that situation, officers or not, would have shot the guy. It funny that if this was about two black officers and dead black criminal.....there would be no hoopla over this incident.

"No matter the eventual reasoning that may come to light, I won't believe it. Some people simply want to hurt, and destroy, and kill, and will convince themselves of whatever they need in order to feel justified. Black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by the police than I, and though there are many reasons for the discrepancy the fact remains that's a horrific statistic that needs to be dealt with. However there's no way you're going to convince me that shooting a bunch of random family men in the back is any way forwards.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else? 

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger.

of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
