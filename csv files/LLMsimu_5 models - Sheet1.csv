"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"All this ""support our"" troops"" stuff is a bunch of drivel.  Why people would respect anyone who is willing to kill someone because they were ordered to by another, is beyond my comprehension. People who volunteer to participate in American gangsterism obviously do so for personal material gain--and they likely wrap their self-interest in the mantle of patriotism or some other nonsense. 
Reinstitute a draft, include women,--go for it. The soft-brained ones will show up ready and willing. A bunch of others will head for the hills with their backpacks in hand and still others will simply head for jail. It could be the beginning of something positive, drafting women.

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

But yeah, I share your feelings that a racist religious terrorist like Ammon Bundy seems to get off easy.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

"Finally someone is speaking up against the rich and powerful Ainsworth Spanish Immersion (ASI) syndicate.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far. The ASI Spanish speakers are mostly rich white Hispanic families, who are now claiming to be part of the historically underserved population. This is an abomination. ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

That is the real injustice here.

"Jules Bailey would have us overlook his church's discriminatory policies simply because he says he disagrees with them.  And anyway, ""we're family"", as if it's just his crazy Uncle Imago Dei in the attic.

Mr. Baily's religion is his private business.  Nonetheless, as a candidate ""running to be a mayor for everybody"", the organizations he chooses to join are a very valid indicator of his beliefs and values.  (Jules, there are hundreds of churches which do not deny civil rights to the LBGT community.  Did you even look?)

Portlanders care deeply when a mayoral candidate chooses to join an organization which denies civil rights to any group.  What if Mr. Bailey chose to join an organization which denied civil rights to blacks?  Women? Moslems? 

As they say, Mr. Bailey, ""you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family.""

"I agree. The super rich will not give up their power willingly and will use violence, CIA dirty tricks, the FBI and whatever other means necessary to prevent the impoverished and exploited masses from taking back the power that rightfully belongs to them.

"Wheeler and Bailey go to vastly different cafeterias.

Wheeler goes to a more inclusive church, and his sky god is not as scary.

 1) A 74 yr old crazy, economically illiterate avowed communist who wrote in the 1970s that the country was close to experiencing a nuclear apocalypse or ""death by poison gas."" but it gets better ...He also claimed cervical cancer was caused by women not experiencing enough orgasms and when he launched his campaign in May, he actually blamed the abundance of consumer goods for child hunger.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. (You are rationalizing warnings about anti-gay and female submission) and Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid (that is pretty much your modus operandi).",Confirmation Bias in Group Dynamics,Closed-Minded Conformity,Confirmation Bias vs. Groupthink: Closed-Minded Conflation,** Confirmation Bias vs. Groupthink**,##   **Dismissal of External Critique through Confirmation Bias Framing**,**Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Minded Conformity**,Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness,** Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness**,**Conflation of Confirmation Bias and Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness**,"** Option 1: Confirmation Bias Disguised as Groupthink: Closed-Mindedness**

"Again with the intellectual dishonesty.

There's a difference between blaming people for
1.  the actions of members of their ethnicity and
2. blaming people for the actions of political and religious groups to which they belong.

As an atheist, I bear some responsibility for what atheists say about God.
I chose to be an atheist, and I give money to atheist groups to broadcast their attacks.  I own that.

I don't bear responsibility for Ammon Bundy just because we are both white.

I have Christian friends, even some fundie friends.  But they aren't running for office or out there espousing and defending bigotry.

The comment reveals a potentially harmful bias within the family's response to dysfunction. While highlighting resilience and the struggle against adversity is important, the  shouldn't gloss over the ethical implications of excluding members based on perceived dysfunction and societal judgment.

**Suggestions for Refinement:**

1. **Focus on Agency:** Instead of simply stating Exclusion or Societal Scrutiny, consider centering the agency of the family and individuals within the social context.

   * **Alternative 1:** A Chickasaw family's resilience against economic hardship is challenged by Huntington's disease, prompting internal divisions fueled by exclusionary practices and interwoven with societal judgment.
   * **Alternative 2:** Navigating the Legacy of Huntington's: A Chickasaw family's journey from poverty reveals internal struggles with dysfunction, fueling exclusionary practices that are both a personal response to adversity and a reflection of broader societal norms.

2. **Highlighting Complexity:**

   * **Alternative 3:** Resilience and Regret: A Chickasaw family's rise from poverty is marked by the devastating impact of Huntington's disease, leading to fraught decisions about inclusion, exclusion, and the complex legacy of dysfunction within a family navigating societal pressures.

**Choosing the Best **

The best  depends on the specific purpose of your analysis.

* If you want to emphasize the family's agency within a social context, choose an alternative that focuses on their decisions and their relationship to societal norms.
* If you want to highlight the internal struggles and the ethical dilemmas, Alternative 2 or 3 might be more appropriate.","- Resilience amid adversity

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

I won't vote any member of Imago Dei.  Do you really think Pastor McKinley is going to change his conservative Baptist ways and reject female submission and embrace equality of gays and heteros?

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike)
and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.

"It's not actually. Diversity has inherent value. If you only hire cisgender white men, only the ideas, talents, and social backgrounds of cisgender white men will be available to you. Plenty of people take that option because of their subconscious racism/sexism/etc... From a libertarian perspective (one I've heard from libertarians, I'm not a libertarian myself), people who do not take diversity into account are robbing their businesses/organizations/bureaus of the success those varied backgrounds can provide - only thoroughly tapping the potential of about 43% of the population.

"This is just further proof that the Malheur occupiers are all mentally ill people.  These are clearly the acts of an unbalanced person.   They need to all either be locked up in prison, or become a patient at a secure mental hospital.

Just look at this image of Scott Willingham taken during the occupation.  Just look at all of the powerful weapons that he is armed with.   And take a look at the absolutely crazed look on his face.   That is clearly the face of a very dangerous insane maniac.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZs_cRHWEAE0-4Q.jpg

Willingham is homeless, and has been living out of his pickup truck for a long time.  He was still in his home state of Texas when the occupation started.  Although only 48, he admitted to the news media during the occupation that he had not worked in a long time.","Dangerous, unstable individual with possible history of prolonged homelessness and unemployment",Pathologization of Protest,"Mental Illness, Danger, and Homelessness: Stigmatizing Perceptions",Mentally Ill and Dangerous,**Dangerous Mentally Ill Outsider**,"1.

 then there are just misfits - and the bad kind who are basically uncaring predators of the other street people.

"My point was that as much as you dismiss Springsteen, or think that you should be able to give him input on his songwriting to have his songs better represent fast food workers, a tiny drop of piss dribbled out of him this morning that's more credible than you in the music industry. He was considered a talented up and coming artist in the early 1970's, he's made top ten records that covered un-coverable independent bands, he wrote for Patti Smith when you were in diapers. 

Have some goddamn respect. 

The reason you look like such a childish person right now is that you are trying to hand-wave away Springsteen's 40 year career as a well-respected, credible, honest, and down to Earth musician, and the only reasons you've given amount to ""he's white, he's got a bunch of money, he doesn't write song about Subway, and he wears jeans"".

"Well, there's a fine line: if one addresses black ""issues,"" such as inequality of opportunity, it can fuel anger among poor whites, many of whom are generational. ""Redneck Manifesto,"" by a Portland guy who raises a seldom touched-upon topic (the generational poverty among whites), exposes the raw feelings that a guy like Trump now is exploiting to great effect.
But not to address, specifically, those issues you mention--- well, that's taken as a slap in the face by African-Americans.

* **Cultural Appropriation:** The core issue is the use of indigenous cultures as tools, rather than genuine engagement.
* **Political Motivation:** This appropriation serves a political purpose, be it gaining power, scoring points against rivals, or signaling allyship. 
* **Moral Superiority:** The act is often framed as righteous, highlighting a self-righteousness that may come across as performative.
* **Polarization:** This phenomenon exacerbates political divisions, appealing to and antagonizing different groups.

**Strong Candidate**

* **Politicized Cultural Appropriation for Moral Superiority** - It succinctly captures the essence of the issue, highlighting the calculated use of culture for self-righteous political gain.
* **Indigenous Cultural Appropriation for Moral Gain: Fueling Political Polarization** - This  explicitly mentions the cultural group being exploited, strengthens the link to political consequences, and emphasizes the exploitative nature of the practice.

**Further Considerations and Refinements**

* **Specificity:** Some s like White liberal.... might be considered too narrow if the issue extends to other groups. It's important to reflect if the user's intent is to solely address white liberals or a broader societal problem.

"Having worked for DOC Alaska for 27 years, I have seen, heard and read about cases where witnesses were disbelieved by the Judge, DA or by the jury. And many of them were whites since white inmates still make up the majority of the prison population. It just isn't about the natives as Mr. Wohlforth like you to think. Question should be, why are some witnesses, regardless of their ethnic background, disbelieved? This isn't just a native problem, its may be a problem for all ethnic backgrounds. There were plenty of witnesses when Ms. Ellis ran over Mr. Dusenbury, and most of them were white folks. Why did DA Campion dismissed them? Mr. Wohlforth is picking and choosing his cases to fit his profile of a racist Alaska criminal justice system but that is a lie. Whites, Asians, Hispanics and Blacks witnesses were often causally dismissed out of hand as any native ones.","Selective Disbelief of Witnesses in Alaska Criminal Justice System, Regardless of Ethnicity",Selective Injustice Narrative,** Systemic Disbelief and Selective Case Use**,The   extracted from the response is: Witness Credibility across Ethnicities.,**Racialized Witness Bias**,Racialized Witness Bias in Selective Narrative,Racialized Witness Disbelief in Selective Narratives,"

"Arun makes a number of good points and offers a perspective that undermines the demagogues of the right. The right loves simple easy answers to complex problems.  They miss their responsibility for creating the conditions that make for a rich soup of angry people who don't see any way out.  Of course we all know that the Iraqi war was the worst response, particular how the first six months were handled. Bush's team was arrogant. Blackwater was arrogant.  Debathification was stupid, and arrogant.  They left stock piles of bombs around Bagdad that slowly dissolved to become IEDs.

"WLTDO: Your comment, albeit accompanied by two article references is abusive propaganda (may I borrow your term agenda?) aimed at  disparaging gay people by offering up an analogy that being gay leads to violence. That is false. The fact is domestic violence can and does happen within all couples, and DV between straight couples is reported on  nearly daily in the RG. It is reported on with no one labeling the event as ""a straight people lifestyle that leads to violence.""  Lifestyle BTW, simply means ""the way a person lives"" e.g. vegan vs meat eater, and that differs from sexual orientation, which refers to the sex a person is attracted to (boy/girl, girl/girl).

* The comment blends a fantastical narrative of extreme fears with a dismissive response to risk, suggesting a sense of security in a privileged context.

**Refinement Suggestions:**

* Specificity: 
    * Could we be more specific about the extreme fears mentioned? For example, instead of just extreme fears, we could say irrational fears triggered by seemingly unrelated events.
* Flow: 
    * The phrase sense of security in a privileged context could be smoother. Consider alternatives like reliance on a privileged sense of security or perception of safety rooted in privilege.

* Subjectivity: 
    * Remember that interpretation is subjective. While the s and summaries aim to be objective, they reflect our own understanding of the text.
* Nuance:
    * The comment walks a fine line between humor, anxiety, and social commentary. Capturing this nuance in a single sentence can be tricky.

"Mr. Wohlforth's commentary appears to suggest that Alaska Natives are nothing but poor innocent victims of a racist justice system. His tone is extremely patronizing and I wonder if he is playing the ""white man's burden"" role here.  This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations. Maybe that is where Mr. Wohlforth should take a look at.",Perception of Native American criminality and justice system bias,**Paternalism vs. Agency**,Paternalistic Stereotyping of Alaska Natives,** Patronizing Racial Stereotypes**,**Cultural Stereotyping & Victimization Narrative**,"1. **Paternalistic Cultural Stereotypes & Victimization Narrative**

"I'm a grandmother and a mother. I'm tired of my rights being ripped to shreds. Example and case and point. While on vacation I went into the women's bathroom in a very populated tourist area. While in my stall I hear a MAN  come into my bathroom. It was a transgender freak who was apparently watching a mentally challenged young 17 year OLD male . This person yelled at this kid treated them like crap,  I was in my stall listening to the whole thing. This troll came into a female's bathroom and obviously was a man acting as a woman there is no place for that in our world. If my granddaughter's had been with me it would have been a whole different situation but because I was an adult and a mother, I was able to just leave the scene.  Angry as hell  because MY RIGHT was infringed.  BORN AS A MAN,  use the men's room.  Just because  you are play acting like a female,  does not make it so.  These people have no moral compass.

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is  them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in  the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be  this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

"People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.
People hate, God does not. I respect the freedom of religion until it tramples on the freedom of others.

"The Catholic Church has never needed permission to pick and choose for whom it would perform any ceremony.

That has not changed because the *states* are now required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples.  There is no relationship between the two.  Obergefell does not require any church to do a single damn thing.  And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out. 

The Catholics used to be focused on things like orphanages and priceless artifacts and poisoning each other at the Vatican.  They should stick to that, and stop trying to gin up more false grist for the propaganda machine that is rapidly destroying our democracy and turning the U.S. into ungovernable factions where every problem has to be solved in federal court.

"Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.

Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.

And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.

I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.  Or another of the remains of a little girl in Fallujah who died screaming as she dissolved in a toxic, super-heated cloud of white phosphorus.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”

That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white ""anti-abortionists."" But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

"What's a 'transgender boyfriend'?  How many 'x'-chromosomes?  And may I suggest you take the trouble to actually become informed about the authentic tenets of my faith before presuming to pontificate on it?  That way you can avoid slagging your own arguments.

And the real joke is that I couldn't marry a second wife--and have it certified--in my OWN Masjid ('mosque').  Because the secular government will impose legal sanctions on any qutb ('preacher') who exercised his right to practice our faith as written in our Scripture.

And there is such a thing as 'freedom of association'.  At least for now.  We don't have to marry you in our Masjid, because by our rules at least one of you has to be Muslim.  For starters.  If the bishop has any sense, he'd take that position as well.

"You're changing the subject. Surprisingly Junior had a valid point. The real gripe of these women is they are horrid negotiators. Most athletes are smart enough to have bonuses established in their contracts for meeting certain goals. I have to laugh when it is pointed out ""The women’s 2015 World Cup win was the most viewed soccer game in the history of American television."" This is a global TV market and American viewership is pathetic compared to the rest of the soccer dominated world where the revenue is generated. This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams.

"Comments sections are great for the same reason Trump is great: they shine a  light on the squalid little black heart of the self-styled ""conservative"" movement and display how vapid and morally and intellectually empty its true believers truly are.

You brought race into this!"" These people who do this are unable to help themselves; they were raised on a steady diet of resentment  and think poking fun at the physical characteristics and ancestry of other people is the height of wit. 

They know they're being left behind by a world that finds them as distasteful and ignorant as the people who threw rocks at little black girls getting off school buses in the 50s.

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  

It's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.

This  captures the essence of the comment, which contrasts the speaker's personal experience with open and diverse bathroom practices in other cultures with their perception of challenges in adopting similar practices in American society.

The comment highlights a disconnect between:

* **Lived experience:** The speaker's firsthand experience with varying bathroom norms globally.
* **Societal norms:** The speaker's belief that American society struggles to accept transgender bathroom use, drawing a parallel with attitudes towards topless swimming.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex.

"A ""history of violence"" you say. That sounds bad! But if you look closer a dog is classified as level-1-aggressive if somebody filed a complaint saying they felt ""threatened"", which can mean anything -- including being barked at. It is not a level-2 or level-3, which are dogs who have actually bit somebody. So you are stretching things quite a bit by saying this dog has a ""history of violence"".

If this dog were such a beast, then why are his neighbors not saying ""good riddance"", or ""serves him right""? No, they are defending the dog owner because they know this dog was harmless and shooting him was a ridiculous over-reaction by a trigger happy idiot.

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954.

* Most s capture the essence of the comment, emphasizing Jesus' teachings, the literal interpretation, and the context of gun violence.
* The s convey a sense of radicalness, harshness, or extremity in the proposed solution.

**Differences:**

* LLM-1's  (Jesus' Solution: Radical Renunciation of Violence) focuses on the renunciation of violence, while LLM-2's  (Radical Literalism) emphasizes the literal interpretation of Jesus' teachings.
* LLM-3's  (Jesus's Literal Solution to Gun Violence) is concise and evocative, highlighting the literal interpretation and context.
* LLM-4's  (Jesus' Radical Solution Unfit for Modern Gun Violence) suggests a mismatch between the radical solution and modern society.
* LLM-5's  (Radical Interpretation of Christian Theology) provides a broader perspective, capturing the tension between piety and violence, historical context, and personal experience.

**Refinements:**

1. **LLM-1's refinement Literalist Interpretation: Jesus' Radical Solution for Gun Violence is a good starting point. To make it more concise, consider Jesus' Literal Solution or Radical Christian Literalism.
2. **Incorporate the context Most s mention gun violence, but LLM-5's  provides a broader perspective. Consider adding a phrase that acknowledges the complex social issue, such as Jesus' Literal Solution to Gun Violence or Radical Christian Literalism in the Context of Gun Control.
3. **Emphasize the tension LLM-5's  highlights the tension between piety and violence. This aspect could be incorporated into other s, such as Jesus' Radical Solution: Tension between Piety and Violence or Radical Christian Literalism: Challenging Modern Values.
4. **Consider the personal experience LLM-5's  mentions the writer's personal experience, which adds a layer of depth to the analysis.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"Thomas Morse:  It's not always nature that people have different needs for like sexual partners.  Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.  The Bible says it's an abomination for a man to lay with another man in the way of a woman.  There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

"Immersion schools are far from immune to racism. I think Mr. Cramer said the Third World War exercise was the extreme example, but overall he suggested that everyday racist logic and assumptions on the part of white people were more common and therefore the more problematic. 
Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism.

"What a shameful way to treat this man. And what a waste of a man's great capabilities. All because some bigot named Boyko found personal pleasure in attacking this good person. I don't know how Boyko can even look at his own face in a mirror. The reflection of a heinous monster staring back at him should be enough to cause him to change his ugly soul. But apparently it isn't. But you know, for every ugly person out there like Boyko, there's more of us who aren't like him. I support my LGBT community members and will always stand up and vote to protect them from unfair practices. It's taking a long time to get where we need to be, but it WILL eventually happen.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

"Sanders risks looking like a sore loser with this whole superdelegate conversion thing.  And whining about the party registration rules.  They have existed for a long time and while it's great that more people are paying attention to the nitty gritty of politics, trying to change the rules during the primaries is waste of time and distraction from the issues such as women rights.  Those who earn superdelgate status have been going to meetings weekly and monthly for years, not just in the election season and election year.  Concerned, involved citizens deserve this position, and they are there to do what's best for the party and avoid demagogues. Sanders is a recent convert as a Democrat, he's not giving the party any money (unlike Clinton) and should be focusing his supporters' attention on taking back the Senate rather than bashing fellow Democrats. He's not really a progressive since he won't go up against the big gun manufacturers and the NRA – a huge disconnect.",Sanders' Disregard for Party Process and Progressive Values,Party Loyalty vs. Outsider Agenda,Questioning Sanders' Authenticity and Allegiance to Progressive Values,Disruption and Divisiveness in Democratic Politics,"**Insufficient Party Loyalty**

This  captures the essence of the comment, which criticizes Sanders for:

* **Disregarding established party rules:** Superdelegate conversion thing and whining about the party registration rules highlight his attempts to change rules during the primaries.
* **Lack of financial and historical commitment to the party:** not giving the party any money and recent convert as a Democrat emphasize his perceived lack of investment.
* **Negative focus on fellow Democrats:** bashing fellow Democrats suggests a disharmony within the party rather than a united front.

The comment implies that Sanders lacks the necessary loyalty and commitment to be a true member of the Democratic party.","Sanders' Disregard for Party Process and Progressive Values, Party Loyalty vs. Outsider Agenda, Questioning Sanders' Authenticity and Allegiance to Progressive Values, Disruption and Divisiveness in Democratic Politics, Insufficient Party Loyalty","1.

"You can't refute my arguments so you indulge in personal attacks by implying I'm a coward.  I've received too many death threats in my lifetime to take that seriously.

See my first reply to you: one of the reasons I oppose these idiots is the harm they do to the environment through their irresponsible 'no-kill' advocacy.  Nor are my activities restricted to Alaska.

Example, 75 MILLION native Australian marsupials, rodents, birds, reptiles and frogs disappear down feral cat gullets each NIGHT, while  animal rights imbeciles like over-the-hill ""sex symbol"" Bridgette Bardot shriek and flail about Aussies' ""murdering cats.""

Sorry, I want my Australian granddaughters to see king parrots, blue-tongued lizards, kookaburras, wallabies, children's pythons, echidnas, White's tree frogs and numbats somewhere other than in a picture-book of extinct Australian animals.

Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison.. So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news.

I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.
Jesus didn't say a word about homosexuality. Sorry but you can't have it both ways.","- Critical analysis of Minnery's actions

"DB - How do you respond to these:
     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?  Does it matter more if a patient dies because the Christian doctor refuses treatment to a gay man, or when the Muslim doctor refuses treatment to a Jewish man?",Religious Beliefs in Conflict with Social Equality and Non-Discrimination,**Challenging Moral Absolutism**,Critique of Religious-Based Discrimination and Its Implications,Religious Ethics and Social Justice,**Religious Exemption - Inequality**,Religious Exemptions and Inequality: Examining Historical Precedents and Slippery Slope Implications,"- Religious Beliefs in Conflict with Social Equality and Non-Discrimination

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

"If a gay person is traveling and a hotel or B&B refuses to accommodate them, it's harmful discrimination.   It can kill.  If a doctor refuses care because you are gay causes real harm.   An exterminator who allows a gay couple to live in filth but not a straight couple is discriminating.  When you open a business, you agree to follow the rule not to discriminate.

"It seems that discrimination is only okay if someone is gay, according to Minnery.  And that's because it's a ""choice"".   Who cares if it is?  Who are they hurting if it is a choice?  The ones I know all say they didn't choose to be gay, and most of them (and their families) knew they were gay or trans before puberty.    The ""gay repair therapy"" was proven useless long ago and one of them even admitted they were a bunch of frauds.  How can someone persecute a small child for something they have no control over?

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved. 

You think that pointing out that white people have enjoyed a long period of benefit from subjugating other races and nationalities is racist? Ooooookay then.",Discriminatory behavior towards marginalized groups.,Discrimination Accountability,Illegality of Discrimination and Moral Judgment,"** Legal Discrimination and Fairness**

The comment discusses scenarios of discrimination, specifically around the legality of refusing service to homosexuals and the corresponding legal consequences. The commenter emphasizes that if a business refuses service because a customer is homosexual, it is illegal. ly, the comment touches on broader issues of fairness and equality, pointing out that any form of discriminatory behavior—whether based on sexual orientation or race—is illegal and should be subject to appropriate legal penalties. Similarly, the comment also hints at historical racial discrimination issues, noting that certain groups have long benefited from discriminating against other races and ethnicities. However, it is important to note that this part is not directly related to the legal penalties discussed in the main theme, but rather appears as an  social commentary. In summary, the core theme can be summarized as a discussion on discriminatory behavior from a legal perspective and its legal consequences.",**Discrimination & Justice**,Unlawful Discrimination and Consequences,"**Refined  Discrimination, Accountability, and Consequences**

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters. I left Anchorage primarily because of the fact that it was hard to get decent (or any) medical care for seniors. The other reason I left was the barbaric treatment of LGBT by the State of Alaska, law enforcement, and the whole GOPtp roster of hateful, pandering political office holders.

"Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cake was clear -- he would bake birthday cakes, cookies, whatever else for ANYONE, but he would not participate in sexual immorality by baking a same-sex wedding cake. Why is it that you folks seem unable to see the distinction here?

A birthday cake or a batch of cookies is not the same as a commitment to a lifestyle of sin ... which is what a same-sex wedding cake symbolizes. As long as gays leave me out of their practice of sin, I am not entitled to discriminate. But when they ask/demand that I participate ... then I have a right to an opinion and the religious obligation to say ""no"".","

# Step 1: Review and Analysis of s
# We have five different s from LLM-1 to LLM-5, each attempting to capture the essence of the commenter's argument regarding refusing to participate in same-sex weddings based on religious beliefs. These s range from Religious exemption request to Religious Exemptionalism, highlighting different aspects of the argument such as morality, participation, complicity, and religious freedom.

# Step 2: Identifying Common Themes
# Upon reviewing the s, common themes emerge, including the idea of setting limits based on personal beliefs (Participation vs. Complicity, Engagement Limits), the moral or religious justification for these limits (Morality-Based Exemption, Religious Objection to Participation in Same-Sex Weddings), and the concept of religious exemption or freedom (Religious Exemptionalism).

# Step 3: Collaborative Refinement
# Given LLM-1's suggestion to refine the  as Religious-Based Participation Limits or Belief-Driven Engagement Limits, we should consider how these refinements capture the essence of the argument. These suggestions aim to concisely convey the idea that the commenter's religious beliefs drive their decision to set limits on their participation in certain activities.

# Step 4: Finalizing the 
# After considering the various s and the common themes they represent, the  should balance between concisely capturing the religious nature of the objection and the limits set by the individual based on their beliefs. It's essential to avoid polarizing language while accurately representing the argument.

# The final answer is: Religious-Based Participation Limits

"And there's the crux of the argument---You view tolerance of homosexuals as a violation of your religious principles, and public acceptance of the LGBTQ community as infringement on your ""religious liberty"" (to discriminate against them).

ms. amylou, I'm not concerned that ""the parts don’t fit"", or anything else that goes on in the bedrooms of consenting adults---It's not my business and it shouldn't be yours either.  You're not being asked to have sex with them, and you're definitely not being asked to help them with that---Only to treat them as equals based on the fact that they are fellow human beings.

"I would love to see a woman with good judgment replace the incompetent and biased (male) Bill Randall as a Planning Commissioner.

I also don't believe age necessarily results in an ""ossified mind"" or that youth ensures ""original thinking.""

I believe in the value of deliberative groups having members with diverse experiences, but a person should reflect competence and sound judgment that have arisen from his or her experiences.

The bit about riding her bike and being appointed by disliked council members is silly. I've seen Nicollelo up-close and she's simply unqualified and demonstrates seriously poor judgment. Her thinking may be ""original,"" but it isn't sound.

"The world is in turmoil because of Mrs. Clinton's incompetence.

Her failure to urge Obama to maintain troops in Iraq allowed ISIS to gain a foothold in the region. Mrs. Clinton also botched her ""re-start"" with Russia, handing the foreign minister a mistranslated ""restart"" button. Russia has resumed its aggressive posture (Ukraine, Crimea), knowing it was amateur hour at the US State Department.

"Your right, this is not Iraq. In the US we have that thing called the constitution, which protects a persons right to free speech. That protection doesn't only apply to speech that you agree with, it applies to everyone.

I find Trump protester's behavior to be usually worse than the behavior or words that they claim to have a issue with. But most are either partisan voters who would probably never vote for the guy no matter how he acted, or they lack intellectual honesty along with common courtesy.

"Hilarious as always Lizzy ! Thanks for stopping into my beauty studio! I completely agree, ""if you're worried that no one will love you with a full bush, you can stop worrying. Turns out, pubic hair has literally nothing to do with love.""

I often rock a full bush (TMI?) and many of our clients see us for all kinds of stuff (facials & relaxation included).

This is confusing because we were told repeatedly by Ted Cruz’s family that God TOLD him to run and now he’s up and quit.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.

"when I first heard trump would be here, I immediately thought how can I thumb my nose at him.  I want to show him no respect, I think he is evil (entitled to my opinion) and that he as president is a most ridiculous and dangerous proposition.

 so I decided the best thing I can do is not go, not feed his rhetoric, not give him a target to rant at, not let him rile the people.  what if nobody went to protest?  would that not take the wind out of his sails?  what would he say?

"If you are a main-reader of the HuffingGlue Post you'd believe such trash. Look at countless online videos that the Media refuses to publish. You'll see the rabid violent zealous hatred of the crazy leftist regressive so-called social justice warriors. When called to back up their claims that 'Trump is racist'----they CAN'T do it. They just then go on to a frustrated name-calling rant against the person questioning them.

* All the s successfully identify key themes: anti-progressive sentiment, frustration with a perceived lack of evidence, negative portrayal of Muslims, and elements of nationalism.
* LLMs-1 & 2 offer slightly different wording but capture the essence effectively.

**Areas for Refinement:**

* **Specificity:** While the s are accurate, they could benefit from greater specificity. For example, instead of simply frustration with evidence gap, consider phrasing that reflects the *type* of evidence lacking (e.g., dismissal of evidence for Trump's alleged racism).
* **Conciseness:** Anti-Progressive Sentiment: Frustration with Evidence Gap... becomes a bit lengthy. Explore shorter alternatives that maintain clarity, like Anti-Progressive Sentiment Rooted in Evidence Denial.
* **Contextual Nuance:** The original comment likely contains subtle nuances that could be reflected in the . Consider whether a single  adequately encapsulates the complexity.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Option 1 (More Specific):** Anti-Progressive Defense Against 'Fake News': Frustration with Trump's Racism Accusations, and Negative Muslim Stereotyping
2. **Option 2 (Concise, Focused):** Anti-Progressive Nationalism: Rejecting 'Fake News' and Demonizing Social Justice Critics

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

"Yale is private, the U of O is not.
Slavery isn't just some long past forgotten event. It lasted for hundreds of years; today, African-Americans still feel they are second-class citizens. Imagine how you, if you're a white person reading this, would feel about attending a school where a building was named in honor of a white person that had owned and mistreated one of your ancestors. Time to forgive AND forget?
I'd argue, ""Hell, no!""
Either one has the capacity to see another's point of view or one doesn't. It simply is unacceptable to continue to praise these men by leaving the buildings' names in place. They've had their day in the sun, it's time to retire them to the shade.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

""George,

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.

"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals.

"No, you misunderstand, Larry. I'm not suggesting that we need efforts to compensate for past injustices -- I'm suggesting that we need efforts to correct for CURRENT injustices. Voting rights are still being denied based on spurious suggestions of voter fraud (which is virtually non-existent, except in the fevered minds of Republican operatives). Some Republicans have even been courageous (or stupid) enough as to admit that their efforts to restrict voting -- which disproportionately affect (otherwise legitimate) Democratic voters -- are intended to help Republicans win elections.

"What I have learned from talking to the rabid Trump supporters is that they believe whatever Trump says, regardless of any factual basis.

"If any billionaire did me a favor, which is statistically improbable, they would at least do it using their own money. Democrats prefer to do favors using taxpayer's money, but only when it benefits them in getting votes.

Actually, my son was offered a favor from a billionaire once in the form of a job when he gets out of the military.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats.""

Conservative Fear Bias", Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception,Irrational Fear & Conservative Threat Perception,"**Key Themes:**

* **Irrational Fear:** The comment emphasizes that the fear discussed isn't based on rational grounds.
* **Political Conservatism:** The comment links this irrational fear to conservative ideology.
* **Ignorance & Threat Perception:** The comment suggests that a lack of knowledge and a heightened sensitivity to perceived threats contribute to this fear.
* **Prejudice:** The comment illustrates how this fear manifests in prejudice against certain groups (e.g., Muslims).

**LLM  Proposals:**

* **LLM-1:** Irrational Fear & Political Conservatism, capturing the core relationship.
* **LLM-2:** Fear-Based Conservatism, more concise, but less specific about the nature of the fear.
* **LLM-3:** Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception, incorporates threat sensitivity and is specific.
* **LLM-4:** Conservative Fear-Ignorance Paradox, highlights the potential contradiction between fear and knowledge.
* **LLM-5:** Fear-Based Prejudice, emphasizes the potential consequences of this type of fear.

**Refined Suggestions:**

* **Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception (LLM-3):** This  effectively summarizes the main themes and captures the specific link between political affiliation, threat perception, and irrational fear.
* **Conservative Fear & Threat Bias (combining LLM-1 & LLM-2):**

This option retains conciseness while encompassing both the type of fear and the potential for biased perception.

**Considerations for Further Refinement:**

* **Specificity:** Do you want to highlight ignorance explicitly? In this case, Conservative Fear, Ignorance & Threat Bias might be more precise.
* **Conciseness:** If brevity is paramount, Conservative Fear Bias (as suggested by LLM-2) could work effectively.",Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception,"1. ** Clustering Grouping the s into clusters based on their similarity in meaning and themes can help identify the most representative s. For example:
   - Cluster 1: Irrational Fear & Political Conservatism (LLM-1), Irrational Fear & Conservative Threat Perception (LLM-1), and Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception (LLM-1 and LLM-5)
   - Cluster 2: Fear-Based Conservatism (LLM-2 and LLM-4), Conservative Fear Bias (LLM-2), and Conservative Fear & Threat Bias (LLM-5)

2. ** Merging Combining the s from each cluster to create a more comprehensive and concise . For example:
   - Merged  1: Irrational Fear in Conservative Threat Perception (combining the themes of irrational fear, conservatism, and threat perception)
   - Merged  2: Fear-Based Conservative Bias (combining the themes of fear, conservatism, and bias)

3. ** Refining Refining the merged s to ensure they are concise, specific, and inclusive. For example:

"I will tell you I was drawn to Ms. Iannarone for a few reasons, not the least of which is that we can't risk Creepy Jules Bailey in a runoff. Do you want someone who uncritically tithes 10-15% of his income depending on who/what you believe his church's mandatory tithe is, to a church that believes gay people are subhuman, interracial marriage is bad, and disabled people don't have souls? Yeah. Creepy Jules will fight dirty in a run-off, and every run-off is dirty.

Ms. Innarone may not have the best soft skills. Nobody elects a mayor based on being nice or Adams and Hales never would have happened. The ""she's sometimes short with people"" is kinda gendered, and y'all know it. So isn't Wheeler, so isn't Davis...

I'll accept Ted if needs be.

- **Moral Objection:** The commenter expresses strong moral opposition to Bailey's support of a church with discriminatory views, describing his financial support as tithing to hate and deeming it unacceptable.
  
- **Tactical Calculation:** Despite acknowledging potential weaknesses in Iannarone's character, the commenter prioritizes her over Bailey due to concerns about his dirty tactics in a runoff election, perceiving a greater risk in Bailey's campaign strategies than in Iannarone's alleged shortcomings.","1.

","** Candidate Support of Discriminatory Beliefs and Campaign Tactics**

This  aims to succinctly reflect the commenter's opposition to a candidate's financial support for a church with discriminatory views and the candidate's potential use of unethical campaign tactics, without judgmental language.","**Strengths of Existing**

* **Specificity:** s like Opposition to Support for Hate via Religion and Avoid Risky and Hate-Fueled Candidate clearly identify the core concerns.
* **Conciseness:** Most s are short and to the point, which is essential for effective coding.
* **Initial Neutrality:** Many s attempt to avoid overtly judgmental language.

**Areas for Refinement:**

* **Overly Specific:** Opposition to Support for Hate via Religion might be too narrow. While the commenter is concerned about this specific aspect, they also express broader worries about Bailey's character and tactics.
* **Subjectivity:** Hate-Fueled Candidate is judgmental and could be interpreted differently. Focus on observable actions and beliefs rather than loaded terms.

**Suggested Refinements:**

1. **Focus on Observable Actions & Beliefs:**

   Instead of Opposition to Support for Hate via Religion, consider:

   * **Financial Support for Controversial Religious Institution** - This captures the specific action without making assumptions about the church's motivations.

2. **Highlight Campaign Concerns:**

   Keep the risk and tactics element:

   * **Concerns Regarding Campaign Strategies & Candidate Associations** - This is broader and allows for further categorization if needed.

3. **Combine for a Balanced **

"I had to move to California for an education that is not available at UAA. No way that I want to go to a college that is building new bullshit buildings and $110 million sports arenas while cutting the only reason we go to school, to get an education! I love the teachers there, but forget paying for some stupid sports and buildings, thinking that this will make people want to move to Alaska for college. Nobody moves to Alaska because one of the pros is that we have a new freaking arena. A great education in my interested field of study is why I would move for school. Not to mention the basketball coach obviously doesn't like black people and everyone knows it. These people who make financial decisions should get schooled by us because this is ridiculous. Do sports make a profit? Does our new arena make a profit? How many kids moved to Alaska to attend UAA because we have sports teams and a new arena?

"Exposure to nudity of the opposite gender in person for a young person unused to it is quite different than exposure on TV, just as exposure to acts of war in person results in PTSD far more than watching realistic depictions of it on TV does.

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them. Those places where restrooms are required will provide a few single user unisex restrooms, resulting in long lines, or restrooms will be pay-to-play like Europe.

"So given this subject is about sex consider this:  which bath/lockeroom would or should gays be ""allowed"" in; i.e. this is the mirror opposite in that a heterosexual child would be more shy if those attracted to he/she are in the same room.

"I don't think she can  afford to play nice.  That's a mistake many liberals make, assuming others will naturally agree with them.   'If we treat them kindly, they will love us and be transformed'.  Not in a 60 minute debate, not with Donald Trump.

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.      I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.  

The question for a significant number of American's is: can Hillary Clinton  be a leader among men? (foreign and domestic).  Cleary many Americans like an 'alpha dog' style of leadership.    Very few people feel Clinton is entittled to anything... she has to fight.

We will see the entire psychodrama played out on stage.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of  votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

Wow so serving in the U.S. military made it okay to do what he did to an innocent man. I am in awe of the way this mobster' s attorneys fought for his life. Too bad there was no one there to fight for Tino's life the night he gave a greedy girl a ride. I say greedy because this crime was committed so the three lazy  idiots could rob a bank. Oh yeah don't forget the victims from the bank robbery. It's their fault for standing in the way of a U S. Veteran right.

"Right on! The nimrods who think there's no difference between Trump and Clinton are playing silly ego games without a clue as to how people's lives may be affected in horrific or uplifting ways.
 
Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

Even if these animals were in excess surely it's the responsibility of the parks board to sort it out and not leave it's borders open to hunters to sort out for them because hunters don't know how to discriminate between what needs to be culled vs what needs to be retained.

  - This acknowledges that the comment reflects the commenter's opinion rather than stating it as fact.
  - Example: Critique of Clinton's Foreign Policy Interventions and Nepotism, with Allegations of Perceived Negative Outcomes

- Identify specific types of interventions if possible:

  - Example: Critique of Clinton's Interventions in [Specific Region] and Nepotism

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Specificity:**

   * Consider using phrases like Criticism of Clinton's Iraq Intervention: 
     or Alleged Nepotism in Appointments.

* **Weighting of Themes:** The s seem to place equal emphasis on foreign policy interventions and nepotism. However, the comment might lean more heavily towards one theme. Analyze the comment's tone and word choice to determine if one theme is truly more dominant. Adapt the  structure accordingly.

* **Clarity and Brevity:**

    * Aim for a  that is concise but still informative.

"People who refuse to study history are doomed to repeat it. The Nazis were one flavor of socialists and looked how well that turned out. The USSR was communist-flavored socialism and 70 years of bread lines until it collapsed. China avoided socialistic collapse by instituting state ""capitalism"", which is just another form of socialism. European socialism is breaking down. What is wrong with the United States economy is a direct result of Keynsian economics (another form of socialism). At what point do we look at history and say ""Let's not go there""?

- **Historical Emphasis:** A Historical Pattern reinforces the comment's focus on learning from past mistakes.
- **Conciseness:** Maintains brevity while incorporating key elements.
- **Clarity:** Easy to understand and apply to similar comments.

**Why This Works Best:**

This  balances the strengths of the previous suggestions:

- **LLM-1's:** Historical Recurrence emphasizes the temporal aspect.
- **LLM-3's:** Recurring Collapse highlights the central idea of repeated failure.
- **LLM-4's:** Socialist Systems' Failures specifies the target.

The addition of A Historical Pattern strengthens the analytical value of the  by directly linking the recurring failures to the broader context of history.

"I simply cannot believe this ramping-up of the PC war against the English language and common sense.  Too many people are getting indignant over imaginary slights created only in their own minds.

If the (sensible) word ""Oriental"" is somehow 'offensive' in reference to those from the Orient, then is the word ""European"" offensive in reference to anybody from Europe?  Honestly, where does this insanity and hypocrisy stop?

(And by the way, for those geographically ignorant Americans --- which is most of them --- who for whatever PC reason prefer the word ""Asian"" to ""Oriental"", let me point out that the continent of Asia consists of MANY more lands, and more peoples, than simply those of the Orient.)

One more thing, why are we English speakers supposed to automatically bow to other language groups when using words in OUR language which refer to them, when THEY do not do the same for us?

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.

"""I am not saying that transgender people are predators. Not by a long shot. What I am saying is that there are countless deviant men in this world who will pretend to be transgender as a means of gaining access to the people they want to exploit, namely women and children.""

"I suspect someone who is 80 and Black might ask, ""comes to America""? Or someone who lived in Vietnam during the war years and saw hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens killed by American bombs might ask, ""comes to America""?
Or the tens of thousands who died during Bush's Shock and Awe campaign, terrified of American missiles and bombs, might ask, ""comes to America""?
Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor. Of course, he and Jefferson were terrible slaveholding murdering fascists who kept fellow humans in chains so that they could get rich.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.

"Might I ask for  facts on the number of evil white pimps as opposed to the number of kind Black pimps and drug pushers?

You are correct, some original colonies and colonists were sent west with grants and titles.   Such as the original Jamestown but just in case you missed it, there was a thing called the revolution where ties with England were severed so I am not sure what 'land grants' you are referring to.  

Yes, a part of this Nation's history contains slaves.  Some of them from Africa where African people captured other African people and sold them to White people.  Yes there are many people today with poor living conditions, education etc which tend to segregate into public housing, living on taxpayer money, single parents, gangs, violence, drugs, riots, and violence.  Many are of African descent.  

Virtually all of their living conditions are a direct result of liberal 'progressive' Democrat policies.

It deflects responsibility for historical injustices by highlighting African involvement in the slave trade and blames liberal 'progressive' Democrat policies for the socio-economic conditions faced by Black people, ignoring systemic racism and historical inequalities.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman.

"""a surge that coincided with the election of the first black U.S. president""

Unless the author is accusing these people of racist behavior, why is this statement in the article? The author could have easily used Barack Obama's name instead of his preferred racial identity.

""...Jerad and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian and also died in a Las Vegas shooting rampage.""

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

It appears these people are sensible, support the Constitution and family values, and have the widely held sense to distrust the government as did our founders.

"DC,

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!  No tar and feathering, no running out on a rail, no lynchings (though I think I do vaguely remember reading about the possibility of a mock lynching).

"Mr Minshall, what exactly do you propose today's society can do to ""correct"" all of those terrible inequities committed by those evil and racist, rich white people?  Especially the ones who have been dead for over 100 years?  

Eliminate the liquor industry?  That was tried once.  Eliminate porn?  What do you suggest, killing all of those who buy Playboy?  Collect all of the prostitutes on the street and give them taxpayer money for life?  Then catch all of the Johns and kill them?   How about the former POTUS and his association with a convicted pedophile, vacationing on a private  sex island?  How about the drug trade?  White owners there too?  Just shoot them all?    

Social engineering by a government does not work.  You cannot force anyone to be free.  Sex trade has been around over 2000 years.  Alcohol has been around as well.

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

Remember, this is the word of God.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

* **LLM-3:** Stands behind their strong choice.

**My Refinements:**

1. **Glorification of Flawed Icons:** (LLM-3's suggestion) Still the strongest due to its directness and ability to capture the contradiction.

2. **Selective Famed Icons:** Slightly more nuanced, hints at a chosen/limited view of the individual.

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

"Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…). 
With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.
You may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls. Aren't you outraged?
Same with Jews: intermarriage is frowned upon, though, unlike Catholics, a woman really can't become a Jew in traditional sense.",Affirmation of racial pride and unity amidst historical and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; emphasizes importance of law-abiding behavior and cultural preservation.,Racial Harmony vs. Societal Constraints,Identity and Interracial Dynamics Across Cultures, Social and Cultural Dynamics of Interracial Relationships and Community Standards**,"**Racial & Religious Boundaries**

* **Social Control and Identity:** It points to the impact of drug-related issues and incarceration on Black identity, contrasting it with the strict rules and boundaries within some religious communities.
* **Comparison of Religious Practices:** The comment draws a parallel between restrictions on intermarriage within Catholicism and Judaism, raising questions about religious exclusivity and potential hypocrisy.

Once changed, you are then that other sex and you should then use that restroom because you then have those parts. That's why men's restrooms have urinals, and women's don't. It's about the parts. 

But if you want to act like a woman (or man) but not change your parts, well, you're still a woman (or man). That's just reality. And no matter which sex you identify with, your parts are still those parts. Your needs are no more important than mine. Why should a majority of people be forced to follow what a minority wants?

"It is the very poor and the middle class that has suffered the most from the programs of the Progressives.  The irony is that the very poor including many blacks and hispanics are the groups who in mass vote for the Democrats, Progressives, Socialists....whatever you want to call them!  The middle class thrived under Reagan and even Clinton but that reversed when Bush took office and then exponentially worsened when Obama took office.  History has shown that no matter how high you raise the minimum wage nothing really changes as the price of living just adjusts up to a higher number of dollars.  Minimum wage is not meant to give the entry level worker a standard of living out of line with their skill levels.  The success of this country is in providing OPPORTUNITY,  not end results.

"Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.

So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam

"This is one of those topics no one wants to touch.

Remember the loners who came up here to places like McCarthy or say Manley Hot Springs.

Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.
Don't think O'Connor doesn't assume (just like you) the wise old man and wise old woman are white. Sotomayor's Latina is in fact wise since according to studies, white men have the most stubbornly racist attitudes and behaviors.",Critical Race Analysis with Intersectional Perspective,Challenging Racial Assumptions,Challenging Misconceptions of 'La Raza' and Critiquing Racism,The   extracted from the response is: Cultural Evolution vs. Institutional Racism,**Reclaiming and Recontextualizing La Raza**,"Reclaiming 'La Raza': Challenging Misconceptions, Critiquing Racism, and Advocating for a Cosmopolitan Ideal","Reclaiming 'La Raza': Challenging Racial Assumptions, Critiquing Institutional Racism, and Advocating for a Cosmopolitan Ideal through Intersectional Lens

You do not do this with other crime.  Do you have a ""statutory assault""....do you have ""date robbery""....do you have ""two college students drunk robbery""?
The answer to this is no.  But with rape, there is always a way to minimize what happened by putting it in these so called classifications, or as you say ""situations.""  Or as you have put it so succinctly - rape is ""no big deal""   Rape is the only thing in the world in which the victim is automatically thought of as ""lying"" - in which there is a never ending supply of excuses blaming the victim and excusing the predator (she was flirting, there was alcohol, she went out by herself etc) - that gets classified for different situations etc.  That's my version of reality, that's the reality the rest of us non-women hating, non-predator advocating people live in.",Victim Blaming and Minimization of Rape Severity,Victim-Blaming Rationalization,Bias in Rape Classification and Victim Blaming,Victim Blaming and Rape Myth Perpetuation,**Victim-Blaming Discourse**,"Rape Minimization and Victim Blaming through Biased Classification

"Class? Republicans are not a ""class"" properly speaking but rather members of the Republican party or voters who vote Republican. Just as Democrats are not socio-economically homogenous, neither are Republicans.
As for shame, reasonable people don't expect cretins to have any which is why Mr. Bahr's letter is so perplexing. I suspect he doesn't have a sense of humor since Trump is obviously supremely ludicrous if in a ""sick humor"" sort of way. Let's face it, he makes all Americans look pretty stupid. But he really is a perfect fit for the Republican party, a sort of culmination of sorts of their years of smoking political crack.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge.

Pay attention victims of domestic violence they will come to your aid if you just admit that protecting someone who claims to love and cherish you in one breath and kicks the shit out of you in the next will never change. Call someone in most cases the cavalry is waiting to help just ask. This is true for men also not every victim is a woman or child. I would like to see a whole new batch of penalties written by victims made into law and force the lawyers and judges enforce the law for the victims not the criminal.

"No one or  group of people deserved to be targeted and  called names ( pig, rapists, criminals) or insulted ( ""Lying"" Ted, ""Crooked Hillary"", ""Little Marco"" or John McCain is not a real war hero) .  Trump uses insults freely such as ""unattractive, dumb, I am smarter, lightweight, boring, clowns, he's a zero, no talent, a waste."" In fact there are hundreds of people he has done this over his decades in the public eye.   There is no way that Trump would expect for people to not be ""offended"" by his speech because that is why he does it. But as this reporter and Trump will cry ""Free Speech"", it has been ruled on by the courts of this nation that such ""Free Speech"" comes with responsibility.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

"WA:The NYT has a well-documented article on Trump in Atlantic City and an editorial by Peter Werner.  Here's a paragraph from the OpEd piece.  Both articles are well worth reading.  ""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana  on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case. This is conspiratorial craziness and rank racism — and all of it has happened after we were told Mr. Trump would raise his game.""",Divisive conspiracy theories and racial attacks,Toxic Rhetoric,Conspiracy and Racist Rhetoric,: Trump's Post-Nomination Racial and Conspiracy Rhetoric,**Degradation of Discourse**,"1.

"You sir/madam, are as misinformed and delusional as the bastard that committed this horrendous act.

It is not the tool that commits acts such as this, but the individual committing them!

Explosive vests are illegal, but he could have just as easily worn one of those and walked into this club and blown himself up, killing and injuring just as many, if not more, innocent victims.

The tools used to commit this horrendous act are not, and should not be the issue.

The ideology of the murderer very much is, whether it be as an radical Islamic believer or supporter, or a radical homophobic. 

Either way, this horrendous act killed and injured over a hundred innocent individuals simply out to have a good time!

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)???

"The president is, of course being chastised for not saying this was ""Islamist"" terrorism.  There is no doubt  that this deranged killer THOUGHT he was acting in the name of Islam and even gave credit to Isis.

What do actual American Muslims  leaders  have to say about the shooting?
""The head of the Council on American-Islamic Relations urged politicians not to ""score points"" or ""exploit fear"" in the aftermath of the attack. Nihad Awad said: 'This is the time for unity and faith.""
""Homophobia, transphobia, Islamaphobia are interconnected systems""
In a direct message to IS, who have said they are behind the attack, Mr Awad said: ""How would you stand before God and answer to your crimes against thousands of innocent people?
""You do not speak for us. You do not represent us. You are an aberration.""

"I thought the original subject was Muslims killing people here in the US.   But I did bring up the Saudi's because you seem to think the anti-homosexual bias is some ancient no longer applicable belief.  You are wrong; if you go to Saudi Arabia and practice homosexuality, you would be DEAD wrong.   

As an agnostic, I think all these religions are merely another tool for egotistical  people to exercise power over those who they convince that their 'religion' has some validity.

I don't think you really have the same view of Islam that I learned from practicing Muslims from both Sunni and Shi'a backgrounds.  They believe.  Islam is the Submission to Allah!  To deny any of  the teachings is to be apostate.  What Muhammed said centuries ago is not 'old testament' stuff.  It is The Word Of God!  To deny anything Mohammed said is punishable by death.

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

* Avoid Judgement: Phrases like Intolerance in Islam vs. Compassion in Christianity can be perceived as value judgments. Religious teachings are complex and often subject to diverse interpretations within each faith. Strive for neutrality by focusing on perceptions and interpretations rather than definitive statements about which religion is more or less tolerant.
* Specificity: While comparative religious teachings on homosexuality is a good start, consider being more specific about the aspects of those teachings being compared. For example, are they comparing scripts, laws, or societal practices?
* Context: Remember that this  is likely part of a larger analysis. Consider if other s in that analysis might need to be adjusted for consistency and clarity.

"And the deflection begins again!

Another shooting, this time part of the 3.5% of the population was the target.  So the typical outcry is eliminate guns or eliminate discrimination or more hate crimes laws.  When the real ""cause"" had nothing to do with firearms or discrimination.  The base cause is cultural.  The shooter's culture vs American culture.

Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American.  As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home.  Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act.  ISIS announced an attack 3 days before.  Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic.  These are the storyline so far.

He and his Father were known to the FBI and ""on their radar"" but the FBI couldn't tie them to any terror cell.  Just like the Boston bomber and the San Bernardino shooters.  The FBI was useless or complicit.

"Rivers, bad idea because if Anchorage create a homeless camp, then Anchorage will be responsible for all the things that goes on in that homeless camp. If this city officially create a homeless camp, it would be a bottomless pit of responsibility and destruction of any sort of financial stability this city ever hope to have. That is why, most cities never adopt such an approach. Cost over run will bankrupt any city. Even places like Honolulu who got homeless problems that utterly dwarf Anchorage's, wasn't that stupid to create a homeless camp.....cost and responsibility simply will be too high. In fact, many cities are now taking the opposite tack, realizing the compassion, care and support for the homeless, are actually enabling and encouraging the homeless.

"I taught my boys that they have to do the work for themselves AND the girl.  That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.  He would be on the hook for child support if a child were produced and he would be the one responsible if she later cried rape.  Yes, girls and women need to be taught that if you dress like a $2 whore and rub up against a guy and heaven forbid add alcohol to the mix, you are asking for trouble.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings. Sexual assault is a horrendous crime against any human, however it is my opinion the term Rape Culture is nonsense and the statement the absence of a no is not consent is just feminist garbage. If you want people to listen to you lose the silly slogans. The problems we are dealing with in our society are breakdown of families, lack of respect for others, lack of self respect and there are too many kids in college that should be digging ditches or learning a trade.

"Reading the article gave me hope for an even handed portrayal of the reactions to this horrific event. It started out in just that way, then veered into a subtle and not so subtle jab at those who are conservative/republican.
In a number of articles about the shooting and reaction to it, many comment about the hate that seems to be on display about all manner of aspects to the reaction to the shooting. 
There is one aspect to the hate that is being displayed that is not addressed. There is the hate for gays mentioned, hate for Muslims mentioned, hate for different races mentioned, etc. The one hate on prominent display but not mentioned is the hate for anyone or anything conservative.

"So, by that token you have studied history and are fully aware of the terror, torture, empire building, murders, and subjugation that the christians have wrought on the world as well. Weren't the crusades nothing more than the christians engaging in the same type of activities on muslims for centuries. 

Really seems like about the only good that comes out of religion is a reason to fight someone else because their beliefs are different. And it cuts both ways. My religion is the only one that is valid in my eyes, as yours is the only one that is valid in your eyes, as Islam is the only one that is valid in the muslim's eye. 

Throw into the mix the complete muck-up the US has made of the middle east since the 60's when we armed so many of our now attackers trying to fight the scourge of communism.

"I keep reading that islam is the fastest growing ""religion""(I think political machine might be a more appropriate term) ... & I wonder how that can be. But then people's values, mores, etc. vary widely. Acquisition of power may be part of the motive. Having nothing to loose may be part. Pure, unadulterated hatred for others -even others of one's own culture, seems to be found in muslim radicals.
How many bad people or even lesser jerks, see themselves that way?
But read the koran, see the numerous passages that urge all types of bad treatment of non-muslims, including death. With that book as their  set of guiding principles - how can any sane person not be islamophobic?

5. **Concern about Islam's radicalizing influence through its religious texts.**

"Another reader, I worked 17 years at DOC Alaska mental health ward so yeah...I have talked with just about every form of mental illness out there. How about you? What we need is a plan of action to deal with the mentally ill because the current approach is simply not working.  You seem to think that all we need to do is give them medication, home and a job. That is naïve at best, stupid at worst.  Mental health is a life time illness so we need a long term plan. And yes, hospitalization must be part of the plan. I dare any mental health clinian out there who claims that he can come up with a medication in a 15 minutes session. It usually requires weeks to come up with what works for just one patient.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again. And they will. Editorials like this are foolish and irresponsible responses to radical Islam.","Misplaced Focus on Tools, Not Root Causes","Gun Violence Denied: Radical Islam Blamed

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape. RAINN argues that removing the impediments to reporting and convicting rapists is the key to reducing rape rates, not lectures and false assertions.","- Raising awareness about rape culture

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color. Using a majority white, relatively crime free population stat to silence the experiences of brown people is a pretty standard way of keeping people of color on the fringes of the reality you and Tyler Hurst live.

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

"This is literally one of the most offensive pieces of writing I've seen in a really long time. 
Beyond the absolute garbage about women ""making"" men have sexual thoughts with their clothing and men being essentially violence driven beings, the idea that pre-marital sex being more commen means that consent is assumed is insane. 

""she created the enhanced risk in the first place since in an age of more casual sex, the male is assuming consent.""

Ummmm.....just NO. There is no situation where consent for sex is assumed because you went in a room. The statement that a woman should be prepared to physically fight and scream to let a man know she isn't just giving her consent by being a woman wearing normal clothing is insane.",Assumption of Consent and Gender Stereotypes,Victim-Blaming Sexism,Victim-Blaming and Gendered Responsibility,Misogynistic Consent and Violence Misconceptions,**Harmful Gender Stereotypes & Consent Denial**,**Challenging Gender Stereotypes and Promoting Consent Culture**,"- Assumption of Consent and Gender Stereotypes

"“You don’t need no gun control, you know what you need? We need some bullet control. Men, we need to control the bullets, that’s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

So even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out.

"Paul….if the sight of 20 dead kids in a classroom didn't change your extreme view of gun rights in this country, then I doubt the Orlando event will.

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms. What does it say about a civilized society that we would have to bleep a statement from the leading Republican candidate because he was being ""truthful""?
For example, ""shit"" ""ass"" ""schlonged"" ""fuck"" ""bullshit"" ""fat ass"" ""bastard"" ""crap"" and ""motherfuckers"". 
People might say ""he won't do this as President"". He is just getting free media attention"" or ""he doesn't mean it"".  But all I have to go on is how people act. That's the best resume for president.

In Baltimore the pathetic mayor ordered police to stand down and allow thugs to blow off steam by destroying buildings and stealing everything they wanted. If law abiding people there had just one assault rifle per home or business---nothing would have been burned down or stolen or there would have been a hundred fewer thugs the next time the court decision didn't go their way.

"This woman is absolutely crazy.   Her Facebook is filled with obscenities and words of hate.  F this, F that, the F word is everywhere on her Facebook.  She appears to be an emotional basket case currently, posting rants almost every day about how miserable she is, and she states that she is drinking heavily.   One of her friends appears to have committed suicide recently, after shooting a woman.

I think that people in the Santa Clara area should stay well clear of her.   She is really messed up pretty bad.   Take a look:

"I wonder why so many liberals parents taught them to use name calling as a way to make themselves seem larger or their point stronger.   I don't mind that people disagree with me .  I just laugh at the way their brains are so small they think name calling makes them appear larger than they really are.  People who have to call others names do so because they don't know how to make their point any other way.   And it's just not me. Look how they called Sullivan names---Danny Boy , Ohio Dan and other names. It backfired.   For reasons only known to them liberals think name calling or intentional mis-spelling a name helps their causes when it doesn't .

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. ly, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion.

His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel. The author offers sound advice on how to minimize the risk of abuse, without exonerating the abuser or blaming the victim, as you seem to be implying.",Accountability and societal changes in gender dynamics,Personal Accountability,Personal Accountability and Societal Shifts,Accountability and Consequence in Changing Times,**Accountability & Agency**,Personal Accountability and Consequences in Changing Gender Dynamics,Accountability and Adaptation in Evolving Gender Norms,** : Accountability and Societal Changes in Gender Dynamics**,Personal Accountability and Evolving Gender Norms Amidst Societal Changes,"**Personal Responsibility and Shifting Gender Norms in a Changing Society**

"I love how white folks talk about how ""color"" is not a factor within the PPS system (you should surely know what it's like to experience systemic racism) and how the ""guise"" of political correctness is often confused with giving marginalized communities respect and recognizing the horrible history of inequity and oppression they've had to endure. My question to the uniformed, yet opinionated commenters is where was your outrage when Native kids were being left behind and left out for generations? Why are you appalled when a disenfranchised community decides to take a larger role in the education of their children in order to address disparities and inequities? What's the difference between ""our"" students and the students of color that NAYA serves? Don't all of our kids deserve access to a quality education?

This has nothing going to do with a “culture of victimhood,” whatever that means, and everything to do with the attempt to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim.

"Evangelicals ""panting desire for affirmation""---oh, Donny, oh, yes, yes, arrest those women ""bleeding out of their whatever""--which Trump is all too delighted to quench--does originate in their feelings of inferiority, feelings that have been successfully exploited for decades. Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.
People not used to witnessing so public a display of licentiousness naturally avert their eyes but others are inured to the lubricious nature of evangelicals having been witness to their grotesque exhibitionism for decades.","Evangelicals' desire for affirmation and political exploitation by Republican Party, stemming from feelings of inferiority and leading to debasement of stigmatized groups.",Exploited Moral Hypocrisy,Exploitation and Craving for Validation,Exploitative Moral Hypocrisy,**Exploitative Manipulation**,"LLM-1: **Exploitative Affirmation Seeking**

"The Torys of England proved, once again, the failure of their ideological policies degenerating into racism and increased fascism throughout the nation.  Those left behind in the Tory deregulatory disaster are brainwashed into believing the problems are all caused by those nasty immigrants too brown or black in visage to be worthy of British citizenship.  Concurrent with our own national Torys(Republicans) whose descent into courting and appeasing the racists, fundamentalist christians, and corporate monopolists results in the nomination of a racist demagogue.  Corporate media stampedes the ignorant and stupid TV/Video generation into acquiecence for millions of dollars in ad revenue.

"Having police go to homes to forcibly disarm Americans in Hawaii is going to raise death by firearms for the police and people who are said to be too sick to have guns. 
Also no gun owner will go seek mental health if they know the police will come and take their guns.
Most mass murders in the US have not been diagnosed with serious mental health conditions.
Registering all firearms with the Federal government will stimulate the Militias and Hate groups most dire prediction to their followers; the government wants your guns so they can take away your freedom.
Add a dash of paranoia and you have your witch's brew.

"Are you kidding me ?  Brandishing a megaphone ?  Heaven forbid . Thank God it wasn't a wet noodle where someone could have really got hurt.    Kidding aside , while it's too bad anyone went down to the Park Strip to protest these people's right to assemble and have their own get together which hurts no one---it's a shame the gay community doesn't show the very tolerance they demand from everyone else.  Why should they take the bait and go after people with only a megaphone ?  Don't they support the very free speech they demand ?  If these protesters are from outside Alaska the gay community ought to take the time to think about how good they have it in Alaska , and not be so quick to always complain about everything.

"David Grisham, why do you and your group of 'not-anti-gay' friends think it's okay for you to pass judgment on gay people?  And of course you will protest that your aren't passing judgment, you're just doing as your god would have you do, which is...well, passing judgment.  YOUR God is a hateful, ugly god. I have no idea how you fools could be a part of any religion that has so much hatred and ugliness attached to it.  Your Christian religion promotes this hatred.  It singles people out as being 'sinful' and not following YOUR god's demands.  YOUR hateful god, I will add.  Believe what you want, since all that hatefulness and and all those lies have been indoctrinated in you probably since your Sunday school days.  That's YOUR belief. Leave people alone.

If you have children, have they ever disobeyed you? Did you kill them? That is what Leviticus calls for.
Have you ever eaten pork? Touched a pig or anything made from a pig? Abomination.

"So here's the thing with homosexuality.  People do not choose to be homosexual, it is how they are born.  Same with heterosexuality, people do not choose to be heterosexual, they are born that way.  

Chaps.  When they are worn, without jeans, are worn with thong bikini bottoms - just like some men and women wear at public beaches.  If they were not wearing anything underneath they would be showing their genitalia, which is illegal.

BTW my fair reference wasn't about cowboys and chaps, it had 
to do with the anti-abortion people and their photos of abortions.

But only four times is there any reference at all — “Laws of Nature and of NATURE'S God,” “Supreme Judge of the world,” “their Creator,” and “divine Providence” — and in all four cases the references to a higher power appeal to the idea of human dignity, never implying a role for a god in government.

It upsets me when I hear about Christians making bad choices like that, it doesn't really represent the Christian community well, it's not kid friendly, and you can't share the love of our Lord and Savior Jesus by screaming hate and hell speech ugh! And I wouldn't want my kids seeing some dude running around in chaps and a thong. Butts, boobs and whatever else should be for adults not kids.

"Thank you Elizabeth for your well written letter.  I blame our regulators.  The AMA approved the sale.  Shame on them.  Shame on Trillium.  Unfortunately, no amount of disgust, sorrow and frustration will change anything.  I posted yesterday my doctors name and her husband.  They've got their million.  I love my doctor and I'm sorry I failed in my now deleted post to express that.  I'd been w/Dr Mary Pugsley for many years and she always, always made me feel like she really cared.  She listened.  She ordered tests when I needed them.  Never hesitated.

It still stands true however, that beginning 3 years ago, she changed.  The 'fake' physicals where we just chatted.  The concern I had over some new strange symptoms that scared me.  She said ""huh, that's not normal"" and then sent me on my way w/no information.  She'd changed.

"What lies did Clinton tell about the attack?  Are you referring to the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" being blamed?

That embassies in Yemen, Pakistan, Egypt and Tunisia were also attacked in response to the film?  The main difference between Benghazi and the other attacks is that the other attacks were all on hardened, purpose built facilities, while the Benghazi attack was on a non-hardened, leased, temporary facility.

"I don't think that anyone needs to ""control"" Trump.

Americans have made excuses for the Right for a long time because they have mostly been harming women and America's misogynist core runs deep. It's so easy to make excuses for religious freaks harassing women. It just seems normal here.

"Wouldn't want to ""simplify""...but appears the root cause/motivation of these acts against the US might just be due to the fact that this nation has been interfering for decades in the internal affairs of numerous (more or less) Muslim nations with which these individuals identify.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

"The only racism I've been seeing is baseless accusations and chips on the shoulders of black transplants obviously uncomfortable in a town full of white people and probably wondering why so few of us want to pal around with them. It's a cultural thing, really; I just don't dig it, same as I didn't dig the crusty old mutant conservative villagers in Switzerland when I lived there. Same as you probably wouldn't dig the company of Amish farmers.

The native Portland white is for the most part a mellow guy who doesn't like confrontation or violence and feels uncomfortable, even disgusted, by garish displays of macho posturing. Knowing that what we regard as civility is considered “pussy” by African Americans who come here with Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes simply adds insult to injury.

"No, not everyone is Portland is racist, but Portland has a long history of racist actions, including wiping out entire black neighborhoods for coliseums and hospitals, and then bitching when a home on a single lot is turned into multiple dwellings.

So, essentially, you despise mainstream black culture because of ""macho posturing, opportunism and predation, and violence including its lesser forms (e.g. coercion, peer pressure etc.)"" and assume that every black person is automatically that way?

Would it be fair to say you hate black culture (because of someone else bullying you) even though you've never personally been affected by it?

And because of that, you assume it's black people's fault they can't get along in white-dominated towns?

Is this really what you're saying?","

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.  

Some high-ranking defectors aside, the Republicans will rally behind Trump because it's all they can do.  He is likely to lose, after which they will blame him, not themselves. So it goes.","- Historical precedent of party defection

"Interesting that this professor feels that the candidate who endorses torture, banning Muslims, punishing women who have abortions, unilaterally starting new wars, et. etc. is the one who defends the Constitution.  Never heard of Claremont McKenna College but it's not a place I'd send my kids to after this.

Trump isn't Hitler.  Nor is he simply 'non-PC'.  Nor is he merely an ""amateur"".  No, he's woefully ignorant of how our constitutional republic is set up to operate.  He engages his mouth without engaging his brain.  He panders to whatever audience he's talking to.  His personal morals and ethics are bankrupt.  He's dishonest.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

The best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.","Hypocritical Business Practices: Hobby Lobby operates commercially on Sundays despite claiming to uphold Christian values, exploiting a loophole by keeping online sales and back-end operations active while physically closing stores.

"From what I saw on the video......this career criminal and sex offender with a record as long as anyone's arm.....was resisting the officers. He had a gun he was trying to pull out and when the officers realized that, they told him to stop but he kept on making the effort to pull out the gun. Anyone in that situation, officers or not, would have shot the guy. It funny that if this was about two black officers and dead black criminal.....there would be no hoopla over this incident.

Actually, I read on Yahoo that they did recovered the gun Mr. Sterling was trying to use. And also.....one of his sex offenses was against a child.

"Metooist:  You raise the key questions relating to religions.  Is god (or God), if he,she, it or they exist, loving or vengeful,  kind or rather nasty?  How about folks who pray to god (God) for rather petty things....victory in a football game for example.....would a god(God) really be interested in such matters?  As we look around us at the harm being done in the name of various gods(Gods), would any supreme being really want such actions?  The list of rather depressing questions could go on for pages.  I've met very loving, wonderful people of all religions.  I've met very loving, wonderful people who are athiests or agnostics.  I've met really nasty, hateful people who are self-avowed Christians, and, again, I've met nasty, hateful people who are agnostics or athiests.  How about radical Muslim zealots.....not really nice folks.  Yet, the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful individuals.  Good is done in the name of religion...so is evil.

"This is a sad day when innocent lives are lost during a police encounter. Its a sad day when our police are targeted and killed because of some very bad decisions by the few. This is getting out of control. Stop this madness. BLM needs to focus also on making blacks lives better not rail against all police. We as a nation know so many crimes are committed by blacks, even blacks on blacks, i.e Chicago? Non blacks are leery of blacks already because of this bad behavior because a large percentage of crimes are committed by them. Personally, I despise the white trash criminal even more. Either way, let justice prevail for officers who make very bad decisions, and yes we need to all come together to understand each other and respect each other.

"No matter the eventual reasoning that may come to light, I won't believe it. Some people simply want to hurt, and destroy, and kill, and will convince themselves of whatever they need in order to feel justified. Black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by the police than I, and though there are many reasons for the discrepancy the fact remains that's a horrific statistic that needs to be dealt with. However there's no way you're going to convince me that shooting a bunch of random family men in the back is any way forwards. This wasn't an act of protest, or justice, or even revenge, just some people wanting the rush of a kill and talking themselves into it. Much the same as a lot of shooters and terrorists today.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum","Escalating cycle of fear, distrust, and anger driven by incidents of violence and polarization.",Escalating Cycle of Fear and Violence,Cycle of Violence and Fear: Escalating Conflict and Distrust,Escalating Violence and Distrust,**Escalating Cycle of Violence & Fear**,"Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust","Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust","**Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust**","Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust","

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it. But as I noted above, Financial Facts I pulled up just using the back of an envelope and 30 minutes show 1 Billion + in savings can be had without touching the PFD, without any new taxes, and without even touching SB21 or the Oil tax Credits. I could do a lot better with a copy of the actual budget in hand. How is it a lower-class, uneducated mutt like myself can find over a billion in savings when our high-class, 70k + per year salaried Oilies in the Legislature can only find the Permanent Fund to Raid?

If the Legislature REALLY wants the people behind it, they need to process all the savings I noted, restructure SB21, and *eliminate*, not DEFER, most of the Tax Credits. Then people will start getting behind more ideas on raising revenues. Until then, it's just the Corrupt Bastards Club having one last hogfest at the Public Money Trough before they jet out of Alaska for their $70,000.00 per year retirement in warmer climes.","- Identifies large potential savings

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past. I'm an example of a successful survivor, but Brianna will never have that chance because someone brutally murdered her. Someone abused her - this time they killed her.  This young woman had her whole life ahead of her. She should still be alive.","

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else? 

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

BLM say that they are non violent and just want to have an honest dialogue and get the problems out in the open so that they can be solved. Then how about addressing the dishonest statistics they cite, how about addressing the way that young blacks respond to any question by a police officer or request by an officer? I was raised on the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Or put another way, approach determines response.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else?

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

"""Of course all lives should matter and the point made by BLM is that they should matter too, not more"".   Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM. What red, yellow, white and brown skinned people hear clearly...is that Black Lives Matter more and are therefore more valued. So how do you explain BLM to the Korean Americans angered by police killing of a young male.  La Habra police were too quick to shoot in New Year's Eve incident, critics say. A young man killed for alledged vandalism with a tire iron but no weapon. A young man of YELLOW skinned pigmentation. Isn't it less damning to say ALL Lives matter and not single out  Blacks. Imagine if you will, what the parents of this deceased young man are feeling every time they see and hear BLM..., he was not black but didn't his life matter?
