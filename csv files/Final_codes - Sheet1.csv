```",Dismissive and Sarcastic Condescension," Refined Caustic Disdain and Non-constructive Engagement**

**Definition:**
Captures instances where participants display caustic disdain and uncooperative engagement, characterized by a lack of respect or consideration for the conversation or others' input, often incorporating sarcasm, derogatory language, or avoidance.

**Sub-Codes:**
1. **Sarcastic Disregard:**
   - Use of sarcasm to diminish the conversation or others' views.
   - *Example:* Your idea is absolutely brilliant, just what we need.
2. **Derogatory Dismissal:**
   - Employing derogatory language to express disregard or contempt.
   - *Example:* That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
3. **Avoidance and Non-engagement:**
   - Deliberately ignoring or avoiding meaningful interaction with the topic or others.
   - *Example:* I don't see why we're even discussing this.

**Considerations:**
- **Context:** Note whether caustic disdain targets the content or the person.
- **Consistency:** Ensure sub-codes align with other engagement codes to avoid overlap.
- **Validation:** Conduct inter-coder reliability tests to ensure consistent intercoder agreement.
- **User-Friendliness:** Maintain clarity and simplicity for ease of use.","Dismissive and Contemptuous Engagement**

**Sub-Codes:**

1. **Sarcastic Remarks:** Use of sarcasm to belittle or mock the conversation or others.
2. **Derogatory Language:** Employing offensive or dismissive language to show contempt.
3. **Refusal to Engage:** Deliberately ignoring or avoiding meaningful interaction with the topic or others.
4. **Expressions of Disdain:** Verbal or non-verbal cues indicating contempt or dismissal.","Code - Dismissive and Contemptuous Engagement**

**Definition:**
The Dismissive and Contemptuous Engagement code is designed to capture instances where participants exhibit dismissive or contemptuous behavior in conversations. This code is intended to provide a nuanced understanding of negative linguistic cues and their impact on discourse.

**Sub-Codes:**
1. **Sarcastic Remarks:** Use of sarcasm to belittle or mock the conversation or others.
   - *Example:* Oh, that's a brilliant idea, as if that could ever work.

2. **Derogatory Language:** Employing offensive or dismissive language to show contempt.
   - *Example:* That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

3. **Refusal to Engage:** Deliberately ignoring or avoiding meaningful interaction with the topic or others.
   - *Example:* I don't see why we're even discussing this.

4. **Expressions of Disdain:** Verbal or non-verbal cues indicating contempt or dismissal.
   - *Example:* This is a waste of time.

**Key Features:**

- **Target of Dismissive Behavior:** The code should note whether the dismissive behavior is directed at the content of the conversation or the person, as this can influence the analysis.

- **Contextual Relevance:** The code should allow for the consideration of contextual factors, such as the relationship between participants or the setting of the conversation, which can affect the interpretation of dismissive behavior.

- **Inter-Coder Reliability:** Regular testing to ensure consistent application of the code across different researchers.

- **User-Friendliness:** The code should be simple and intuitive, with a guide or checklist to aid in consistent application.

- **Adaptability:** The code should be designed to evolve, allowing for the incorporation of new forms of dismissive or contemptuous behavior as they emerge.

By implementing these improvements, the Dismissive and Contemptuous Engagement code will be a more effective tool for analyzing conversations, providing a nuanced understanding of negative linguistic cues and their impact on discourse.","Evasive Disdain, Sarcastic Dismissal, Contemptuous Disregard","1. **Evasive Disdain**: A response that avoids direct engagement while conveying a sense of disdain or disrespect.
2. **Sarcastic Dismissal**: A response that uses sarcasm to dismiss or ridicule the other person's opinion or statement.
3. **Contemptuous Refusal**: A response that refuses to engage or acknowledge the other person's perspective, often with a tone of contempt or superiority.","The final agreed qualitative codes for dismissive responses are Evasive Disdain, Sarcastic Dismissal, and Contemptuous Disregard."

Description: This code encapsulates two distinct but interconnected themes. First, it addresses the contrast between perceived and actual racism in Oregon's history, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation of historical narratives in the face of evidence. Second, it explores the dual nature of social media's impact on teenagers' mental health, highlighting both the potential for increased anxiety and depression and the provision of community support. By examining these two themes through a nuanced and evidence-based lens, this code promotes a comprehensive understanding of the historical and social factors that influence racism and mental health.

Cross-cutting Themes:
- Critical evaluation of historical narratives
- Contrast between perception and evidence
- Dual impact of social media on mental health
- Anxiety and depression
- Community support provision

This final agreed qualitative code focuses on the importance of examining historical narratives and social media's impact on mental health through a nuanced, evidence-based approach. It encourages critical thinking and avoids biased language, resulting in a concise, clear, and comprehensive code that effectively captures the core findings of both studies.","1.
