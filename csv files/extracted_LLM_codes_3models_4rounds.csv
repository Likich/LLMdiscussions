"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

"Ms. Slovic:

Wow.  Thanks for this.  I love the disconnect between Bailey attending a somewhat scary church (female submission, anti-gay) and being a progressive.  It shows something hard to define, but not very likable, about his character.  He's kinda wishy-washy.   

I, for one, don't want a candidate who acts on woo-woo beliefs
and goes to a church that disdains the lifestyles of many Portlanders.

Gay people, co-habitors, feminists should consider whether they want Bailey to lead the city, given his almost schizoid spirituality (my church is great even if the doctrines and clergy are backwards and bigoted).

"Finally someone is speaking up against the rich and powerful Ainsworth Spanish Immersion (ASI) syndicate.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far. The ASI Spanish speakers are mostly rich white Hispanic families, who are now claiming to be part of the historically underserved population. This is an abomination. ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. (You are rationalizing warnings about anti-gay and female submission) and Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid (that is pretty much your modus operandi).",Confirmation Bias in Natural Groups,Defensive Groupthink Rationalization,Differentiating Confirmation Bias from Groupthink: Dynamics of Group Influence,"Differentiating Confirmation Bias from Groupthink in Natural Groups

"My Chickasaw mother was 2nd youngest of 12 children. I had Uncles old enough to be great grandfather. I had 3rd cousins older than my parents. Point being, this family was humongous until Huntington's disease killed 3/4 of my family in a 12 year span.

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

I won't vote any member of Imago Dei.  Do you really think Pastor McKinley is going to change his conservative Baptist ways and reject female submission and embrace equality of gays and heteros?

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike)
and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.

Today that orchard would be fined into bankruptcy for putting my family to work when Grandma and her 12 kids thumbed a ride to Oregon from Oklahoma, coming here homeless and destitute to look for work and overcome third world poverty in America, Pulling our kids from agriculture was one the most retarded things liberals have done as they have created a generation of snowflakes with 0 work ethic.",Valuing hard work and family tradition: Resistance to perceived 'snowflake' culture,Cultural Work Ethic vs. Exploitation,Work Ethic and Intergenerational Family Values,Intergenerational Cultural Work Ethic: Resistance to Perceived Exploitation,**Refined Code:** Intergenerational Cultural Work Ethic: Balancing Heritage and Exploitation Concerns,Work Ethic and Intergenerational Family Values,"Culturally Rooted Work Ethic and Intergenerational Family Values: Resistance to Perceived Exploitation

"Alaska is already the gun death capitol of the U.S. We lead the nation in men killing woman, forcible rape, and suicide. Anchorage is the most dangerous city for women and Fairbanks is the second most dangerous in America. Putting more guns in the hands of our young men and woman is not going to solve this problem. Why doesn't our legislature focus their energy on addressing the true issues in Alaska which are gun violence, suicide, rape, murder...

"Having worked for DOC Alaska for 27 years, I have seen, heard and read about cases where witnesses were disbelieved by the Judge, DA or by the jury. And many of them were whites since white inmates still make up the majority of the prison population. It just isn't about the natives as Mr. Wohlforth like you to think. Question should be, why are some witnesses, regardless of their ethnic background, disbelieved? This isn't just a native problem, its may be a problem for all ethnic backgrounds. There were plenty of witnesses when Ms. Ellis ran over Mr. Dusenbury, and most of them were white folks. Why did DA Campion dismissed them? Mr. Wohlforth is picking and choosing his cases to fit his profile of a racist Alaska criminal justice system but that is a lie.

"Mr. Wohlforth's commentary appears to suggest that Alaska Natives are nothing but poor innocent victims of a racist justice system. His tone is extremely patronizing and I wonder if he is playing the ""white man's burden"" role here.  This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations.

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

- **Adaptability**: Experiential Validity of Opinions is a good compromise as it's both concise and adaptable to various contexts while maintaining the core argument.

- **Specificity vs. Generality**: Depending on the use case, one might prefer a code that is more specific (like the original LLM-1 code focusing on racial justice) or more general (like Experiential Validity of Opinions). 

- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Experiential Authority and Experiential Validity of Opinions both offer clarity and conciseness, making them effective for summarizing the main argument across different contexts.

- **Encompassing Marginalized Communities**: It might be beneficial to ensure the final code acknowledges the specific concern for marginalized communities, as the original issue centers around racial justice and the validity of opinions from those who are not part of these communities.

**Final Suggestion**: 
Experiential Validity of Opinions seems to be a well-rounded and refined code that encapsulates the essence of the discussion. It maintains a balance between being concise and adaptable while emphasizing the core argument about the validity of opinions being rooted in personal experience. If there's a need to specifically highlight marginalized communities or certain types of issues (like racial justice), the code could be slightly adjusted to Experiential Validity in Marginalized Contexts or a similar specification, depending on the application and desired specificity.",Experiential Validity of Opinions,"- Experiential Validity of Opinions

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

"People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.
People hate, God does not. I respect the freedom of religion until it tramples on the freedom of others.

That has not changed because the *states* are now required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples.  There is no relationship between the two.  Obergefell does not require any church to do a single damn thing.  And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out.

"Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.

Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.

And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.

I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

"What's a 'transgender boyfriend'?  How many 'x'-chromosomes?  And may I suggest you take the trouble to actually become informed about the authentic tenets of my faith before presuming to pontificate on it?  That way you can avoid slagging your own arguments.

And the real joke is that I couldn't marry a second wife--and have it certified--in my OWN Masjid ('mosque').  Because the secular government will impose legal sanctions on any qutb ('preacher') who exercised his right to practice our faith as written in our Scripture.

And there is such a thing as 'freedom of association'.  At least for now.  We don't have to marry you in our Masjid, because by our rules at least one of you has to be Muslim.  For starters.  If the bishop has any sense, he'd take that position as well.

"You're changing the subject. Surprisingly Junior had a valid point. The real gripe of these women is they are horrid negotiators. Most athletes are smart enough to have bonuses established in their contracts for meeting certain goals.

This is a global TV market and American viewership is pathetic compared to the rest of the soccer dominated world where the revenue is generated. This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams. It stills falls back on the women who failed to negotiate bonuses like the rest of their professional sports peers.

"It is a tough issue.  Trump's campaign rallies are hives of violence and bigotry.  His campaign is supported by the KKK and numerous anti-immigration hate groups.

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  

It's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.

"Mr. Black, I read about southern white people who would say virtually the same thing as you during the civil rights era.  They would say that Black people in the south were perfectly happy being treated barely better than slaves and who were the civil rights workers to come down there and rile them up with ideas that they were equal with whites and entitled to vote and an education and things like that?

// This code snippet represents a qualitative analysis of how dominant groups justify inequality.
// It focuses on identifying patterns and themes in the language and arguments used by these groups.

// Theme 1: Meritocracy
// Dominant groups often argue that inequality is a result of differences in individual effort and ability.
// They claim that those who work harder or are more talented naturally rise to the top.

// Theme 2: Natural Order
// Another common justification is the belief in a natural hierarchy.
// This perspective suggests that inequality is a reflection of inherent differences between groups.

// Theme 3: Economic Efficiency
// Some argue that inequality is necessary for economic growth and innovation.
// The idea is that rewarding the most productive individuals leads to overall societal benefits.

// Theme 4: Cultural Deficiency
// Dominant groups may attribute inequality to cultural or behavioral deficiencies in marginalized groups.
// This justification shifts the blame away from systemic factors and onto the individuals themselves.

// Theme 5: Historical Context
// Inequality is sometimes justified by referencing historical events or traditions.
// This argument suggests that current disparities are a continuation of long-standing practices.

// Note: These themes are not mutually exclusive and can often be found in combination within dominant group narratives.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing.

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"Thomas Morse:  It's not always nature that people have different needs for like sexual partners.  Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.  The Bible says it's an abomination for a man to lay with another man in the way of a woman.  There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

"Sanders risks looking like a sore loser with this whole superdelegate conversion thing.  And whining about the party registration rules.  They have existed for a long time and while it's great that more people are paying attention to the nitty gritty of politics, trying to change the rules during the primaries is waste of time and distraction from the issues such as women rights.  Those who earn superdelgate status have been going to meetings weekly and monthly for years, not just in the election season and election year.  Concerned, involved citizens deserve this position, and they are there to do what's best for the party and avoid demagogues. Sanders is a recent convert as a Democrat, he's not giving the party any money (unlike Clinton) and should be focusing his supporters' attention on taking back the Senate rather than bashing fellow Democrats.

Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison.. So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news.

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

"DB - How do you respond to these:
     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?  Does it matter more if a patient dies because the Christian doctor refuses treatment to a gay man, or when the Muslim doctor refuses treatment to a Jewish man?",Religious Freedom vs. Discrimination Dilemma,Challenging Exclusivity,Religious Justification of Discrimination Challenged,"1.

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

""Refusing to associate"" is different from discriminating.  Religious people don't have the right to use their religion as an excuse to harm others who only want to do business with them.

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

"Great point, so how does a business owner tell if someone is ""gay"" and refuses to bake that cake for their wedding. I am an outdoor hetro female who dresses in jeans and fleece.

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters. I left Anchorage primarily because of the fact that it was hard to get decent (or any) medical care for seniors. The other reason I left was the barbaric treatment of LGBT by the State of Alaska, law enforcement, and the whole GOPtp roster of hateful, pandering political office holders.

"This is what small government looks like. To be clear, a lot of other Valley neighborhoods are used as drunken playgrounds for idiots. It's really just about attracting and pandering to discourteous people, people who litter and race their ATVs and dirt bikes on residential roads. 

Reminds me of the sleazy Anchorageites who successfully lobbied the Assembly to let them throw their drunken parties and take over a small residential lake every weekend, making the actual residents miserable. Those Anchorageites were insufferably self righteous about their entitlement to trash a Valley neighborhood on the weekends with their equally sleazy friends. 

The Assembly took the side of the weekenders over the actual residents.

I also don't believe age necessarily results in an ""ossified mind"" or that youth ensures ""original thinking.""

I believe in the value of deliberative groups having members with diverse experiences, but a person should reflect competence and sound judgment that have arisen from his or her experiences.

The bit about riding her bike and being appointed by disliked council members is silly. I've seen Nicollelo up-close and she's simply unqualified and demonstrates seriously poor judgment. Her thinking may be ""original,"" but it isn't sound.

"The world is in turmoil because of Mrs. Clinton's incompetence.

Her failure to urge Obama to maintain troops in Iraq allowed ISIS to gain a foothold in the region. Mrs. Clinton also botched her ""re-start"" with Russia, handing the foreign minister a mistranslated ""restart"" button.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

""George,

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.

All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats."" There are many other studies confirming this.

He programmed that boy with anti-white hate and seated within him a great fear of law enforcement officers.

"Exposure to nudity of the opposite gender in person for a young person unused to it is quite different than exposure on TV, just as exposure to acts of war in person results in PTSD far more than watching realistic depictions of it on TV does.

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them. Those places where restrooms are required will provide a few single user unisex restrooms, resulting in long lines, or restrooms will be pay-to-play like Europe.

"It is tough, but even Ted Bundy's mom loved him to the almost very end, sticking up for his innocence and finally realizing that he indeed was the serial killer of so many young women. It is natural to have blinders on when you have adult children and I think one reason that by some miracle you son or daughter will straighten out, parents have eternal hope, the way we are wired. Perhaps they thought his girlfriend would inspire him to be a good member of society, of course it probably would not have. Maybe his parents were terrified of him. Who knows, but I am sure for one thing, his parents are just as sad at the way things turned out. My question is why did not she not leave him, was she terrified to?

"I don't think she can  afford to play nice.  That's a mistake many liberals make, assuming others will naturally agree with them.   'If we treat them kindly, they will love us and be transformed'.  Not in a 60 minute debate, not with Donald Trump.

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.      I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.  

The question for a significant number of American's is: can Hillary Clinton  be a leader among men? (foreign and domestic).  Cleary many Americans like an 'alpha dog' style of leadership.    Very few people feel Clinton is entittled to anything... she has to fight.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

_He calls Hillary Clinton a *****.""_ -- From prior post, after it was edited.

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

Yeah, that's a sensible way to manage a comments feature.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

"Mike Dunham's request that we ""give black soldiers their due"" is a ridiculous one, at best.  This is not a new story: as other posters have stated, the role of black soldiers' contributions has already been reported in other publications.  Dunham claims ""their role was severely downplayed,"" yet never once states how.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.  That's the way the Nazis thought.  That's the way the da'esh (""ISIS"") thinks now.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.

I also think that a doctor/pharmacy shouldn't ever be forced to write/fill a prescription they don't feel comfortable with.","- Respect for personal choice

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.

 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.

"That alone makes Hillary unfit for office. The reputation of our nation does not need a President that cannot be open to our citizens and allies without creating scandal. Even Milbank admits scandal has dogged her for 25 years. Do voters think it will magically stop? The dodge that it is always a conspiracy of the right is not only worn thin, it is absurd when she cannot even speak to the Inspector General for the State Department appointed by her own party, and prevents her staff from doing so as well.

"Mr Minshall, what exactly do you propose today's society can do to ""correct"" all of those terrible inequities committed by those evil and racist, rich white people?  Especially the ones who have been dead for over 100 years?  

Eliminate the liquor industry?  That was tried once.  Eliminate porn?  What do you suggest, killing all of those who buy Playboy?  Collect all of the prostitutes on the street and give them taxpayer money for life?  Then catch all of the Johns and kill them?   How about the former POTUS and his association with a convicted pedophile, vacationing on a private  sex island?  How about the drug trade?  White owners there too?  Just shoot them all?    

Social engineering by a government does not work.  You cannot force anyone to be free.  Sex trade has been around over 2000 years.  Alcohol has been around as well.

"The disfunction of the Mexican government certainly doesn't help matters.    I'm just saying that NAFTA was a bad deal for their nation.     There are good reason that people leave the nation to find work elsewhere.    If you or I were in a similar life we might also risk our lives for our families.    

I think we'd agree  that the influence of gangs is just crazy.    While we complain that our Central goverment is too large/controlling, the central goverment of Mexico is still grossly weak and incompetent.

What would you do with gangs in American communities?   

Why will our government spend billions 'protecting' citizens in the middle east, but won't spend billions fighting back at our own urban wars?   I've got some possible explanation, I bet you do as well.

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

Remember, this is the word of God.

"Practical Man @ Wyatt Earth:  Although I'm not sure if you are a man or woman by your writing, my point would be the same.  If my wife and I were out walking as these 2 ladies were, but we were armed as we usually are, and YOU were being stomped by a moose, or your mate, or your children, or your grandchildren, would you ask us to help, or tell us paranoids to just keep out of it? 

 Having had to use my handgun to stop violent crimes, both times the victims stated SO CLEARLY that had it not been for me stopping the criminal act, it would have turned out much much worse, or even deadly, FOR THEM, AND THEY WERE INNOCENT.  It's just SO amazing that SO many anti-gun people change their mind when the hated implement saves their lives.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

"Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…). 
With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.
You may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls. Aren't you outraged?

"Transgender is such a small segment of the population but somehow has commanded and demanded that the majority bow to their demands. I don't want to share a restroom with someone of a different gender, doesn't matter if the person identifies with my gender or not. It's not about being 'transgender'. You were born with certain parts. That's just how it is. If you want to get a sex change operation, then fine. Once changed, you are then that other sex and you should then use that restroom because you then have those parts. That's why men's restrooms have urinals, and women's don't. It's about the parts. 

But if you want to act like a woman (or man) but not change your parts, well, you're still a woman (or man). That's just reality. And no matter which sex you identify with, your parts are still those parts. Your needs are no more important than mine. Why should a majority of people be forced to follow what a minority wants?

"Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.
Don't think O'Connor doesn't assume (just like you) the wise old man and wise old woman are white. Sotomayor's Latina is in fact wise since according to studies, white men have the most stubbornly racist attitudes and behaviors.","Code: La Raza as inclusive, transcending racial divisions while acknowledging persistent racism in institutions and challenging assumptions of white wisdom",Reclaiming Cultural Identity,Critique of Racial Essentialism and Systemic Racism,"1.

You do not do this with other crime.  Do you have a ""statutory assault""....do you have ""date robbery""....do you have ""two college students drunk robbery""?

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge.

"Oh, c'mom, Paul.  I very much enjoyed your comment.  It was good for a giggle.  However, I'm cursed with PC-itis, and feel guilty about such giggles.  I then feel compelled to apologize, and, were I Catholic, I'd likely say a hundred ""Hail Mary""s.  

Additionally, (and in a serious vein)  I worked with developmentally delayed students and find jokes about ""idiots"", ""retards"" etc insulting to them. 

 It's a struggle going through life so damn PC.  Moreover, at the same time, I've always been a fan of the ""under-dog"", a Red Sox fan, and voted for McGovern.  I think those things go together.  I also ""take-in"" stay dogs and give money to panhandlers.

"No one or  group of people deserved to be targeted and  called names ( pig, rapists, criminals) or insulted ( ""Lying"" Ted, ""Crooked Hillary"", ""Little Marco"" or John McCain is not a real war hero) .  Trump uses insults freely such as ""unattractive, dumb, I am smarter, lightweight, boring, clowns, he's a zero, no talent, a waste."" In fact there are hundreds of people he has done this over his decades in the public eye.   There is no way that Trump would expect for people to not be ""offended"" by his speech because that is why he does it. But as this reporter and Trump will cry ""Free Speech"", it has been ruled on by the courts of this nation that such ""Free Speech"" comes with responsibility. An example of this is that one cannot yell ""fire"" in a crowded theatre.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

"WA:The NYT has a well-documented article on Trump in Atlantic City and an editorial by Peter Werner.  Here's a paragraph from the OpEd piece.  Both articles are well worth reading.  ""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case. This is conspiratorial craziness and rank racism — and all of it has happened after we were told Mr. Trump would raise his game.""",Divisive Conspiracy Theories and Racist Attacks,Trump's Divisive Rhetoric,Inflammatory Rhetoric and Conspiracy Theories,Divisive Conspiracies and Attacks,"1.

"Of course it is about religion, and no matter what you or others say people thankfully still believe their ""lying eyes."" Your trying to excuse it away as nothing more than individual acts of insanity or violence is naive, and will, in the end, cost many lives.

Spreading Christianity or defending it had nothing to do with Iraq. It was deluded response to the attacks of 9/11. 

So stay smug and keep flattering yourself by reminding yourself how noble and tolerant you are. And don't actually study religion or burden yourself with problematic realities; just keep espousing your vacuous, blindly-tolerant, views and hope the blood doesn't spill too close to your back door.

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)???

"I thought the original subject was Muslims killing people here in the US.

As an agnostic, I think all these religions are merely another tool for egotistical  people to exercise power over those who they convince that their 'religion' has some validity.

I don't think you really have the same view of Islam that I learned from practicing Muslims from both Sunni and Shi'a backgrounds.  They believe.  Islam is the Submission to Allah!

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

"Rivers, bad idea because if Anchorage create a homeless camp, then Anchorage will be responsible for all the things that goes on in that homeless camp. If this city officially create a homeless camp, it would be a bottomless pit of responsibility and destruction of any sort of financial stability this city ever hope to have. That is why, most cities never adopt such an approach. Cost over run will bankrupt any city. Even places like Honolulu who got homeless problems that utterly dwarf Anchorage's, wasn't that stupid to create a homeless camp.....cost and responsibility simply will be too high. In fact, many cities are now taking the opposite tack, realizing the compassion, care and support for the homeless, are actually enabling and encouraging the homeless. We should also understand that many of the homeless who are mentally ill....often choose NOT to take their medication during the period when they are totally lucid, able and high functioning.

"I taught my boys that they have to do the work for themselves AND the girl.  That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.  He would be on the hook for child support if a child were produced and he would be the one responsible if she later cried rape.  Yes, girls and women need to be taught that if you dress like a $2 whore and rub up against a guy and heaven forbid add alcohol to the mix, you are asking for trouble.  So I want to read an article about how to teach your girls not to put themselves in vulnerable positions where a cad can take advantage of them.

"True fact that. But in a bad situation, a less bad situation is better. The bad guy had control for over 3 hours. Hell if everybody just threw their cell phones at the guy he could have been overtaken with fewer casualties. Waiting 3 hours while texting your last few thoughts is beyond the pale. When the bad guys figure out the success this has had they will come with a dozen gunmen next time and take over a dozen venues. They will hit and run in Gorilla fashion. Neither the Police nor the Army can stop them. The only way to limit this kind of attack is through the use of neighborhood Militias.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings. Sexual assault is a horrendous crime against any human, however it is my opinion the term Rape Culture is nonsense and the statement the absence of a no is not consent is just feminist garbage. If you want people to listen to you lose the silly slogans. The problems we are dealing with in our society are breakdown of families, lack of respect for others, lack of self respect and there are too many kids in college that should be digging ditches or learning a trade.  Society has glamorized the beer guzzling and hook ups. Women will be women and men will be men, or whatever you decide to identify as on any given day of the week.

"Reading the article gave me hope for an even handed portrayal of the reactions to this horrific event. It started out in just that way, then veered into a subtle and not so subtle jab at those who are conservative/republican.
In a number of articles about the shooting and reaction to it, many comment about the hate that seems to be on display about all manner of aspects to the reaction to the shooting. 
There is one aspect to the hate that is being displayed that is not addressed. There is the hate for gays mentioned, hate for Muslims mentioned, hate for different races mentioned, etc. The one hate on prominent display but not mentioned is the hate for anyone or anything conservative.

"How many NRA guys have done any of these shootings over the years? Answer is NONE. The only people shooting things up are Liberals, and Islamists. Virtually every, single, time.  This guy wasn't a ""nut"" as you like and your ilk repeatedly try to label him. He was a full-blown, Islamist Jihadi, raided in a radicalized family that was allowed to immigrate into the US in 2003. So what Frank? What's your story on the Jihadis who set off those pressure cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon? What, you're going after Martha Stewart or Chef Ramsey now? Fact is this guy was on the FBIs watch list, he associated with guys that went over to fight for ISIS. His Dad was at least supportive of some Islamist groups abroad and maybe here in the U.S.  Maybe you can explain Islam is in conflict with every culture that it comes into contact with that isn't already Islamic?

"Another reader, I worked 17 years at DOC Alaska mental health ward so yeah...I have talked with just about every form of mental illness out there. How about you? What we need is a plan of action to deal with the mentally ill because the current approach is simply not working.  You seem to think that all we need to do is give them medication, home and a job. That is naïve at best, stupid at worst.  Mental health is a life time illness so we need a long term plan. And yes, hospitalization must be part of the plan.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape. RAINN argues that removing the impediments to reporting and convicting rapists is the key to reducing rape rates, not lectures and false assertions.",The qualitative code from the response is: Culture and Underreporting of Rape: Barriers to Justice and Prevention,Unpacking Rape Culture: Accountability vs. Education,Challenging Rape Culture Myths and Advocating for Systemic Change,"1. **Challenging Rape Culture Stereotypes and Promoting Accountability**

"Someone asked, and yet again racism is at play, if white children should be adopted by white folks. Yeah, why not. But recent events have allowed white people to adopt and take in as foster children, kids of Native parents and there were LONG lines at the DFYS taking advantage. Why? MONEY. When a Native child is placed in a non-Native home, the payment for care doubles. Another add-on is something called ""cultural difference"" stipend. So white folks got more money to ""care"" for Native kids than Native people. Money talks, BS walks. Hence the long list of white folks on the rolls.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"Bill Clinton's economic conservatism did not occur in a vacuum. You will recall Newt Gingrich's ""Contract with America"" and the fact that Republicans obtained a majority in Congress in 1994. Obama is also an economically conservative Democrat and also faced a Republican majority in the House. Progress will be made when the Republican party is fully repudiated and the Democrats take over the political center. The Republican party is showing its true colors in Donald Trump. With the Republicans, you've got a range from ""weapons of mass destruction"" Dick Chaney to ""deport all the Mexicans and Muslims"" Donald Trump and their followers range from misogynist Christians to knuckle dragging white supremacists.

"And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color.

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?

I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

"I wonder why so many liberals parents taught them to use name calling as a way to make themselves seem larger or their point stronger.   I don't mind that people disagree with me .  I just laugh at the way their brains are so small they think name calling makes them appear larger than they really are.  People who have to call others names do so because they don't know how to make their point any other way.   And it's just not me. Look how they called Sullivan names---Danny Boy , Ohio Dan and other names. It backfired.   For reasons only known to them liberals think name calling or intentional mis-spelling a name helps their causes when it doesn't . With the gay rights vote they called everyone bigots and homophobes and worse . They were leading in the polls until the naming calling---and they lost. Think about it.","Certainly!

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives.

Now Loretta Lynch claims she does not know where the wife who helped the shooter is, so does that also include the FBI?""

Another shooting, by a muslim declaring terrorist associations.  Blame the gun.
Another theft, burglary, robbery, murder, etc.  Blame drugs, blame society, blame anything except the person who commits the crime!  

Many of these crimes are by repeat offenders or those on a 'watchlist' of known gang members, drug dealers.  Just what good is a watchlist anyway?  Does it really help the investigation after the crime is committed?  Are all of those who law enforcement have been watching pulled in for questioning?

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel.

"Evangelicals ""panting desire for affirmation""---oh, Donny, oh, yes, yes, arrest those women ""bleeding out of their whatever""--which Trump is all too delighted to quench--does originate in their feelings of inferiority, feelings that have been successfully exploited for decades. Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.

"Obama is importing Islamic fundamentalists? What vintage are they? Are they still in the box?

Or maybe with a link you could show us where you get this news? I only ask because the idea that the President is personally importing terror is silly at best and seditious at worst.

"No, you are wrong. You are rude and ignorant that Native Alaskans have for centuries regulated their own fishing and done very well with it. The Elders understood and established the rules.

"Ongtooguk nailed the most pervasive, inflammatory part of the gun-grabber 'debate': out of one side of their mouths, they wail, 'we must have new restrictions only to help save our children' , while out of the other they espouse that total confiscation is their ultimate goal, the outright disarming of every citizen, with only the military and police being armed. 

I'm sure that worked great for the Jewish people being rounded up for a trip to Auschwitz. Thanks, but I'm not taking that ride. The Second Amendment has been certified by the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Deal with it.

When the gun-control lobbyists can't discuss the facts, can't get past the 'Scary Assault Rifle' balderdash, continue to press for more restrictions with less enforcement of the restrictions we *already have*, and instantly knee-jerk react to any gun-owner who doesn't  agree with them as a lunatic whackjob looking for defenseless people to murder, where can a reasonable discussion begin?",Hypocrisy and fear-mongering in gun control debate; resistance to infringement on Second Amendment rights.,Gun Control Hypocrisy,Contradictory Hypocrisy in Gun Control Discourse: Fear of Tyranny and Dismissal of Reasonable Dialogue,Hypocritical Gun Control Discourse: Fear of Tyranny and Disregard for Reason,"- Hypocrisy in gun control debate

"So, a couple of questions. While you're spreading the ""truth"" are you quoting those popular verses in Leviticus? The clobber verses?
Speaking of Leviticus, are you wearing blended fibers? According to that book of the Bible, it's an abomination. 
While you're here in Alaska, have you enjoyed our excellent, varied crab dishes? Scallops? Clams? Shrimp? Oops, that too is an abomination.
This might be a wee bit indelicate, but has any female member of your household stayed under your roof while they're menstruating? Yup, abomination.
If you have children, have they ever disobeyed you? Did you kill them? That is what Leviticus calls for.
Have you ever eaten pork? Touched a pig or anything made from a pig? Abomination.
I see you're clean shaven and have cut the hair from around your temples. Oh boy. You really like to rebel don't you?
Do you have a garden? I sure hope you have different gardens for each plant, otherwise, abomination.

It still stands true however, that beginning 3 years ago, she changed.  The 'fake' physicals where we just chatted.  The concern I had over some new strange symptoms that scared me.  She said ""huh, that's not normal"" and then sent me on my way w/no information.  She'd changed.

The main difference between Benghazi and the other attacks is that the other attacks were all on hardened, purpose built facilities, while the Benghazi attack was on a non-hardened, leased, temporary facility.  The deaths in Benghazi had nothing to do with Clinton, but rather with the office of Diplomatic Security failing to properly harden the building (and with congress failing to provide funding so that they could).",Inadequate security and unrelated to Clinton's lies.,Deflecting Blame: Benghazi as Misattributed Accountability.,**Code:** Clinton's Innocence Amid Security Failures,Security Failures and Clinton's Innocence,"1.

We should all just sit back and enjoy this truly American reality/comedy show while it lasts.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

Did you read the story I linked to carefully? It is disturbing to say the least.  

I see in Trump a psychopath who will say anything to get elected.   I feel so creeped out by this election, and wish that the Republican nominee was someone not-a-rapist.   I am not a fan of Rubio, but he is sane & not a sex offender.  Have you thought about the libertarian candidate?

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.  

Some high-ranking defectors aside, the Republicans will rally behind Trump because it's all they can do.  He is likely to lose, after which they will blame him, not themselves.

Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

The best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.","```yaml

"From what I saw on the video......this career criminal and sex offender with a record as long as anyone's arm.....was resisting the officers. He had a gun he was trying to pull out and when the officers realized that, they told him to stop but he kept on making the effort to pull out the gun. Anyone in that situation, officers or not, would have shot the guy. It funny that if this was about two black officers and dead black criminal.....there would be no hoopla over this incident.

Actually, I read on Yahoo that they did recovered the gun Mr. Sterling was trying to use. And also.....one of his sex offenses was against a child.

"Metooist:  You raise the key questions relating to religions.  Is god (or God), if he,she, it or they exist, loving or vengeful,  kind or rather nasty?  How about folks who pray to god (God) for rather petty things....victory in a football game for example.....would a god(God) really be interested in such matters?  As we look around us at the harm being done in the name of various gods(Gods), would any supreme being really want such actions?  The list of rather depressing questions could go on for pages.  I've met very loving, wonderful people of all religions.  I've met very loving, wonderful people who are athiests or agnostics.  I've met really nasty, hateful people who are self-avowed Christians, and, again, I've met nasty, hateful people who are agnostics or athiests.  How about radical Muslim zealots.....not really nice folks.  Yet, the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful individuals.  Good is done in the name of religion...so is evil.

"No matter the eventual reasoning that may come to light, I won't believe it. Some people simply want to hurt, and destroy, and kill, and will convince themselves of whatever they need in order to feel justified. Black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by the police than I, and though there are many reasons for the discrepancy the fact remains that's a horrific statistic that needs to be dealt with. However there's no way you're going to convince me that shooting a bunch of random family men in the back is any way forwards.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum",Qualitative code: Escalating Fear and Anger leading to Polarization and Potential Violence,"Escalating Cycle of Fear, Distrust, and Anger",Escalating Violence and Fear Cycle,"1.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it.

I could do a lot better with a copy of the actual budget in hand. How is it a lower-class, uneducated mutt like myself can find over a billion in savings when our high-class, 70k + per year salaried Oilies in the Legislature can only find the Permanent Fund to Raid?

If the Legislature REALLY wants the people behind it, they need to process all the savings I noted, restructure SB21, and *eliminate*, not DEFER, most of the Tax Credits.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger.

"""Of course all lives should matter and the point made by BLM is that they should matter too, not more"".   Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM. What red, yellow, white and brown skinned people hear clearly...is that Black Lives Matter more and are therefore more valued. So how do you explain BLM to the Korean Americans angered by police killing of a young male.  La Habra police were too quick to shoot in New Year's Eve incident, critics say. A young man killed for alledged vandalism with a tire iron but no weapon. A young man of YELLOW skinned pigmentation. Isn't it less damning to say ALL Lives matter and not single out  Blacks. Imagine if you will, what the parents of this deceased young man are feeling every time they see and hear BLM..., he was not black but didn't his life matter? I am trying to imagine you explaining BLM to this young mans family.",Perceived hierarchy within BLM movement,Perceived Exclusivity,Perceived Exclusivity vs. Inclusivity in BLM Discourse,Perceived Exclusivity vs. Inclusiveness in BLM,"- Perceived Exclusivity vs. Inclusiveness in BLM

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
He later recounted ""I was relieved to see a white man."" 

And from where does such an ingrained response stem from? 
A history of a much higher crime rate among African-Americans.
Everyone knows this, even other African-Americans.",Implicit racial bias in police responses,**Institutionalized Bias**,**Code:** Ingrained Responses Rooted in Historical Context,"1. Ingrained Law Enforcement Responses Rooted in Historical Crime Context
