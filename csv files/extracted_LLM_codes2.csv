"I hope a psych evaluation isn't done.
I want these people thrown in prison forever -not have some defense lawyer claim that something is wrong with the parents, who then escape justice because of some condition that suddenly pops up with a psychiatric test. These people knew better regardless of what some mental test says, and I don't care what anyone else says.
Guarantee you they knew, which is why they went to such lengths to keep it a secret.
These people should be thrown in a pit and left to fend in the same manner as their daughters, but forever.",Call for Punishment without Mental Health Consideration,Punitive Retribution,Resistance to Psychological Defenses in Justice,"- Punitive Retribution: Opposition to Mental Health Defenses

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.

#### **Additional Code: Critique of Trump's Views on Women**
**Definition:**  
This code captures the content-specific critique of Trump's stance on women, including discussions of his behavior or attitudes toward women.

**Subcodes:**
1. **Critique of Trump's Treatment of Women**  
   - Definition: Direct criticism of Trump's behavior or attitudes toward women.
   - Example: Trump hates women.

2. **Discussion of Supporters' Perspectives**  
   - Definition: Commentary on how supporters (including some women) may overlook or condone Trump's behavior.
   - Example: Some women don't seem to care.

---

### **Guidelines for Applying the Codes:**

1. **Primary Focus:**  
   - Use Reflective Reconciliation as the primary code when the comment centers on acknowledging a mistake, apologizing, and fostering positive dialogue.
   - Apply Critique of Trump's Views on Women when the comment specifically addresses Trump's stance on women.

2. **Combining Codes:**  
   - If a comment contains both reflective reconciliation and a critique of Trump's views, both codes can be applied simultaneously, with Reflective Reconciliation as the primary focus if the apology and attempt to reconcile are prominent.

3. **Subcode Application:**  
   - Use subcodes to further specify the nature of the comment. For example, if the comment includes both an apology and a critique of Trump, apply both main codes with their respective subcodes.

4. **Coding Guidelines:**
   - Always ensure that the codes are applied consistently across comments to maintain reliability.
   - If a comment does not explicitly address Trump's views, focus solely on Reflective Reconciliation.

---

### **Example Application:**

**Comment Example:**  
I did misspeak. MY APOLOGIES TO YOU. I'm sorry for thinking you were a jerk. I look forward to future conversations. Trump hates women, and some women don't seem to care.

Slavery isn't just some long past forgotten event. It lasted for hundreds of years; today, African-Americans still feel they are second-class citizens.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate.

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.

"What I have learned from talking to the rabid Trump supporters is that they believe whatever Trump says, regardless of any factual basis.  Trump supporters believe that Muslims were celebrating in the streets of New Jersey during the 9/11 attacks, they believe that it is constitutionally correct to specifically discriminate against Muslims, and that all immigrants are to blame for our problems here in America.  Trump supporters as a whole are angry white people looking to blame the government for their failures in life. Most Trump supporters appear to have a very limited understanding of the basics of government, and they are happy to  support a vulgar man who acts like a 12-year-old boy.

"If any billionaire did me a favor, which is statistically improbable, they would at least do it using their own money. Democrats prefer to do favors using taxpayer's money, but only when it benefits them in getting votes.

Actually, my son was offered a favor from a billionaire once in the form of a job when he gets out of the military. As it so happens, they were seated next to each other on an airplane flight, in coach. The guy didn't believe in owning a private airplane or flying first class. My son checked this guy out later, and he was legitimate.

""Angry white people blaming government for our failures in life?"" I thought we were the privileged, the 1 percent. Funny how liberals use both sides of an argument as it suits them. But most Trump supporters recognize his petulance and know he is not right on all issues, but he will get some things done that no Beltway politician will even attempt.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats."" There are many other studies confirming this.

"I will tell you I was drawn to Ms. Iannarone for a few reasons, not the least of which is that we can't risk Creepy Jules Bailey in a runoff.

"You seem to be saying something along the line of ""boys will be boys"", and that not all women are offended by Trump's actions.  And to make it worse, you throw out the red herrings of transgender bathrooms and people's personal liberty as if that personally has an effect on your life.
Then you throw out a bare straw man argument about Bill Clinton and infidelity.  
Mr. Trump is on his 3rd marriage, of which he proudly admits he cheated on his now wives and with other mistresses.  He makes tasteless sexual remarks about his own daughters.  He shows no respect to the women in his life that he should show ultimate respect to.

Mrs. Clinton made her decision regarding her marriage infidelity and for whatever reason chose to keep her marriage intact.  The Clinton's raised a daughter who is a college graduate and a successful working woman.

"It is tough, but even Ted Bundy's mom loved him to the almost very end, sticking up for his innocence and finally realizing that he indeed was the serial killer of so many young women. It is natural to have blinders on when you have adult children and I think one reason that by some miracle you son or daughter will straighten out, parents have eternal hope, the way we are wired. Perhaps they thought his girlfriend would inspire him to be a good member of society, of course it probably would not have. Maybe his parents were terrified of him. Who knows, but I am sure for one thing, his parents are just as sad at the way things turned out. My question is why did not she not leave him, was she terrified to?

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.      I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.  

The question for a significant number of American's is: can Hillary Clinton  be a leader among men? (foreign and domestic).  Cleary many Americans like an 'alpha dog' style of leadership.    Very few people feel Clinton is entittled to anything... she has to fight.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.

A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by.

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

"Right on! The nimrods who think there's no difference between Trump and Clinton are playing silly ego games without a clue as to how people's lives may be affected in horrific or uplifting ways.
 
Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

"I simply cannot believe this ramping-up of the PC war against the English language and common sense.  Too many people are getting indignant over imaginary slights created only in their own minds.

If the (sensible) word ""Oriental"" is somehow 'offensive' in reference to those from the Orient, then is the word ""European"" offensive in reference to anybody from Europe?  Honestly, where does this insanity and hypocrisy stop?

(And by the way, for those geographically ignorant Americans --- which is most of them --- who for whatever PC reason prefer the word ""Asian"" to ""Oriental"", let me point out that the continent of Asia consists of MANY more lands, and more peoples, than simply those of the Orient.)

One more thing, why are we English speakers supposed to automatically bow to other language groups when using words in OUR language which refer to them, when THEY do not do the same for us?  Again, this artificial but purposely divisive non-issue is simply nonsense and hypocrisy run wild.","```

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.

"I suspect someone who is 80 and Black might ask, ""comes to America""? Or someone who lived in Vietnam during the war years and saw hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens killed by American bombs might ask, ""comes to America""?

Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor. Of course, he and Jefferson were terrible slaveholding murdering fascists who kept fellow humans in chains so that they could get rich.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
