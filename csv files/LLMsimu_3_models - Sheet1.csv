The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, undertrained cops that beat up protestors.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

"""This is also part of what is behind abortion."" Gay people, fewer gay men than gay women, get abortions. The good news is, whereas hetero women get pregnant with what's-his-brother's-name and can have 8 children by 8 daddys, if gay people put enough thought and effort into it, they too can produce children. The fact that fing easily produces a child is extremely unfortunate for thousands of children who live in domestic violence, abandonment, neglect, squalor - and are subjected to horrific acts of sexual and physical abuse by their parents, friends of parents, or mom's new boyfriend.

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion. It is a sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon. And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic. All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.

"How wrong art thou?  Let me count the ways:

(1) I'm an 'Ahmed', not a 'Judah'

(2) And you offer yet another example of what my dear friend, returned to his Lord eight years now, once observed--no people make a greater show of their 'humility' than so-called 'Christians'

(3) And none so frequently--and falsely--claim 'persecution'

(4) One who admonishes keeping God's Law while failing to do so is not only a hypocrite, he embraces arrogance--""Anna khairum min'hum; I'm BETTER than him"".  Satan first uttered that blasphemous fallacy before God Himself

(5) I'm a staunch critic of both the Zionist entity and Da'esh (wrongly called 'Islamic State'--there's nothing Islamic about them).  I've denounced the Sa'ud family--their ideological and financial backers--in Minah, Saudi Arabia, and was threatened with death for it.  Can you say the same?

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  

It's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex.

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"Thomas Morse:  It's not always nature that people have different needs for like sexual partners.  Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.  The Bible says it's an abomination for a man to lay with another man in the way of a woman.  There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

We've erased the ancient line that was drawn between right and wrong in regards to marriage, and put ourselves on a terrible trajectory.  I don't believe most advocates of homosexual marriage intend or see the path they've put us on. But the sky's the limit now; the wall has been torn down.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

See my first reply to you: one of the reasons I oppose these idiots is the harm they do to the environment through their irresponsible 'no-kill' advocacy.  Nor are my activities restricted to Alaska.

Example, 75 MILLION native Australian marsupials, rodents, birds, reptiles and frogs disappear down feral cat gullets each NIGHT, while  animal rights imbeciles like over-the-hill ""sex symbol"" Bridgette Bardot shriek and flail about Aussies' ""murdering cats.""

Sorry, I want my Australian granddaughters to see king parrots, blue-tongued lizards, kookaburras, wallabies, children's pythons, echidnas, White's tree frogs and numbats somewhere other than in a picture-book of extinct Australian animals.  And I would prefer they not have to struggle to survive amidst ecological collapse or cat-vectored  pandemics.

So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city.

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

"DB - How do you respond to these:
     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.

The coach later apologized when she discovered the man was transgendered but explained there were girls using the facility as young as six years old who weren’t used to seeing male genitals.","- Exposing male genitals

   - Apply Critique of Trump's Views on Women when the comment specifically addresses Trump's stance on women.

2. **Combining Codes:**  
   - If a comment contains both reflective reconciliation and a critique of Trump's views, both codes can be applied simultaneously, with Reflective Reconciliation as the primary focus if the apology and attempt to reconcile are prominent.

3. **Subcode Application:**  
   - Use subcodes to further specify the nature of the comment. For example, if the comment includes both an apology and a critique of Trump, apply both main codes with their respective subcodes.

4. **Coding Guidelines:**
   - Always ensure that the codes are applied consistently across comments to maintain reliability.
   - If a comment does not explicitly address Trump's views, focus solely on Reflective Reconciliation.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

"Ruiz's pathetic response: 

""George,

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.

"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats.""

"I'm still waiting for something substantive to come out of Mr. Trump's mouth in the way of an actual plan as to how he is going to ""Make America Great Again.""  Calling anyone who doesn't support Trump ""empty headed"" is exactly what we expect from Donald Trump and his supporters. Obama haters have spent the past eight years ranting about how horrible things are under our ""Muslim"" president.  The tea party reared its ugly head, came to power, yet nothing was accomplished. Those same radical extremists have now thrown their weight behind Donald Trump, who offers only vague promises and further divides America with his divisiveness and hateful rhetoric.  So I would like to see Mr. Trump act presidential and hear him engage in some intelligent and respectful discourse instead of his continuous verbal dysentery of random insults and vulgarity.

"Arvin Kangas should be charged for 1st degree murder. He didn't pull the trigger but he set the stage and responded in a way that led to the intentional murder of two of Alaska's finest troopers.

He programmed that boy with anti-white hate and seated within him a great fear of law enforcement officers.

"I had to move to California for an education that is not available at UAA.

"Exposure to nudity of the opposite gender in person for a young person unused to it is quite different than exposure on TV, just as exposure to acts of war in person results in PTSD far more than watching realistic depictions of it on TV does.

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them. Those places where restrooms are required will provide a few single user unisex restrooms, resulting in long lines, or restrooms will be pay-to-play like Europe.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation.

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"I agree all immigrants should be documented as required.  I believe the status of the Parent and Child must be the same, that of the parent.    I want a favorable stance on firearms as well - but I don't think we want the same thing.    (I have no problem with ownership, most of my friends own one or more firearms).   

Abolishing trade pacts would be a very bad idea.   People only hear what they lose, not what the win.   NAFTA was far worse for Mexico than it was America.

I understand the masculine vs feminine conflict we have been seeing in the country.   It's hard for some men to adjust to the loss of power where the number of jobs that women hold, has been growing for 40 years.  (Positions that women have earned!).

"Right on! The nimrods who think there's no difference between Trump and Clinton are playing silly ego games without a clue as to how people's lives may be affected in horrific or uplifting ways.
 
Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

"Jade, emotionally I agree, of course, but then I remember we have a diverse student body and we shouldn't  tar and feather the whole bunch .  This  action represents  the well-off  fun-loving  collegiate subculture which partly overlaps with the Greek system.   As  much of the UO's recruitment now focuses on getting high income/tuition-paying  students whose grades won't get them in to the better California schools this portion is  likely growing at the UO.  

But we also have large numbers of  quality  students who take their academics seriously and wouldn't waste their time on this stupidity; And many others who have to work long hours to pay our increasingly excessive tuition.   Many of these still carry the Webfoot values of social   justice and environmental awareness. Lets' not let them suffer for the actions of  those jerks at Shasta.

Now, apparently anyone can go and request to change their gender on a birth certificate. WHAAAT?? So there are no rules anymore to keep order.

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.  That's the way the Nazis thought.  That's the way the da'esh (""ISIS"") thinks now.

Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor. Of course, he and Jefferson were terrible slaveholding murdering fascists who kept fellow humans in chains so that they could get rich.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.

Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.

Second, it explores the dual nature of social media's impact on teenagers' mental health, highlighting both the potential for increased anxiety and depression and the provision of community support. By examining these two themes through a nuanced and evidence-based lens, this code promotes a comprehensive understanding of the historical and social factors that influence racism and mental health.

Cross-cutting Themes:
- Critical evaluation of historical narratives
- Contrast between perception and evidence
- Dual impact of social media on mental health
- Anxiety and depression
- Community support provision

This final agreed qualitative code focuses on the importance of examining historical narratives and social media's impact on mental health through a nuanced, evidence-based approach. It encourages critical thinking and avoids biased language, resulting in a concise, clear, and comprehensive code that effectively captures the core findings of both studies.","1.

"Mr Minshall, what exactly do you propose today's society can do to ""correct"" all of those terrible inequities committed by those evil and racist, rich white people?  Especially the ones who have been dead for over 100 years?  

Eliminate the liquor industry?  That was tried once.  Eliminate porn?  What do you suggest, killing all of those who buy Playboy?  Collect all of the prostitutes on the street and give them taxpayer money for life?  Then catch all of the Johns and kill them?   How about the former POTUS and his association with a convicted pedophile, vacationing on a private  sex island?  How about the drug trade?  White owners there too?  Just shoot them all?    

Social engineering by a government does not work.  You cannot force anyone to be free.  Sex trade has been around over 2000 years.  Alcohol has been around as well.

"The disfunction of the Mexican government certainly doesn't help matters.    I'm just saying that NAFTA was a bad deal for their nation.

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

Remember, this is the word of God.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

"Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.  And they list the Nation of Islam as a racist group that spreads hatred.  And Ali has been a member ever since 1964.  They are an extremist fringe sect of Islam with less than 40,000 members.  

So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam

Here is quote from their description of NOI:

""The Nation of Islam's theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.""

"There you go, stay the course. It is your hatred/machismo combination that gained you a following by others who hate and appreciate you talking tough and hateful.

The issue here is the whole world is disturbed by Trump's hatred, forget about what the GOP thinks- they have never been concerned what Americans actually think. In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump. The GOP card has been about hate long before Trump- how about: women can't control their own womb, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more coroporation rights than individual rights, problems with what room you go to the bathroom in, who you marry. The racism and hate has always been not far from the GOP, mimicking the traditionally racist south on voting lines. Also no coincidence, it is the vastly undereducated that support the GOP...anyone with an education can see nothing but hate/corporate profiteering and little else.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge. Sadly, looking at the statistics for our legal system's incarceration and execution of black males relative to their rates of committing crimes, a whole lot of our judges don't belong on the bench.",Judicial Bias and Class Privilege,Elitist Bias in Judicial System,Judicial Bias and Systemic Injustice,"1.

"Oh, c'mom, Paul.  I very much enjoyed your comment.  It was good for a giggle.  However, I'm cursed with PC-itis, and feel guilty about such giggles.  I then feel compelled to apologize, and, were I Catholic, I'd likely say a hundred ""Hail Mary""s.  

Additionally, (and in a serious vein)  I worked with developmentally delayed students and find jokes about ""idiots"", ""retards"" etc insulting to them. 

 It's a struggle going through life so damn PC.  Moreover, at the same time, I've always been a fan of the ""under-dog"", a Red Sox fan, and voted for McGovern.  I think those things go together.  I also ""take-in"" stay dogs and give money to panhandlers.

"No one or  group of people deserved to be targeted and  called names ( pig, rapists, criminals) or insulted ( ""Lying"" Ted, ""Crooked Hillary"", ""Little Marco"" or John McCain is not a real war hero) .  Trump uses insults freely such as ""unattractive, dumb, I am smarter, lightweight, boring, clowns, he's a zero, no talent, a waste."" In fact there are hundreds of people he has done this over his decades in the public eye.   There is no way that Trump would expect for people to not be ""offended"" by his speech because that is why he does it. But as this reporter and Trump will cry ""Free Speech"", it has been ruled on by the courts of this nation that such ""Free Speech"" comes with responsibility. An example of this is that one cannot yell ""fire"" in a crowded theatre.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

"Of course it is about religion, and no matter what you or others say people thankfully still believe their ""lying eyes."" Your trying to excuse it away as nothing more than individual acts of insanity or violence is naive, and will, in the end, cost many lives.

Spreading Christianity or defending it had nothing to do with Iraq. It was deluded response to the attacks of 9/11. 

So stay smug and keep flattering yourself by reminding yourself how noble and tolerant you are.

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)??? How many Muslims are there who claims to be gay??

As an agnostic, I think all these religions are merely another tool for egotistical  people to exercise power over those who they convince that their 'religion' has some validity.

I don't think you really have the same view of Islam that I learned from practicing Muslims from both Sunni and Shi'a backgrounds.  They believe.  Islam is the Submission to Allah!

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

Hell if everybody just threw their cell phones at the guy he could have been overtaken with fewer casualties. Waiting 3 hours while texting your last few thoughts is beyond the pale.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings. Sexual assault is a horrendous crime against any human, however it is my opinion the term Rape Culture is nonsense and the statement the absence of a no is not consent is just feminist garbage. If you want people to listen to you lose the silly slogans. The problems we are dealing with in our society are breakdown of families, lack of respect for others, lack of self respect and there are too many kids in college that should be digging ditches or learning a trade.

There is one aspect to the hate that is being displayed that is not addressed. There is the hate for gays mentioned, hate for Muslims mentioned, hate for different races mentioned, etc. The one hate on prominent display but not mentioned is the hate for anyone or anything conservative.

"How many NRA guys have done any of these shootings over the years? Answer is NONE. The only people shooting things up are Liberals, and Islamists. Virtually every, single, time.  This guy wasn't a ""nut"" as you like and your ilk repeatedly try to label him. He was a full-blown, Islamist Jihadi, raided in a radicalized family that was allowed to immigrate into the US in 2003. So what Frank? What's your story on the Jihadis who set off those pressure cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon? What, you're going after Martha Stewart or Chef Ramsey now? Fact is this guy was on the FBIs watch list, he associated with guys that went over to fight for ISIS.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape.

"Bill Clinton apologized for his actions, he said he was"" profoundly sorry for the burden he imposed on Congress and the American people."" 

his 60% approval rating was an indication of the collective loss of IQ points of the American populace. its indicative of the fact that you view politics as a team sport. 

it goes hand in hand with the portion of the comment that you failed to acknowledge.  
why are GWB and his administration vilified even today for actions of over ten years ago but when BHO administration does the exact same thing you give him a pass? not just a pass, you are carrying that vile woman to the white house on your shoulders like some hero.

"Someone asked, and yet again racism is at play, if white children should be adopted by white folks. Yeah, why not. But recent events have allowed white people to adopt and take in as foster children, kids of Native parents and there were LONG lines at the DFYS taking advantage. Why? MONEY. When a Native child is placed in a non-Native home, the payment for care doubles. Another add-on is something called ""cultural difference"" stipend. So white folks got more money to ""care"" for Native kids than Native people. Money talks, BS walks. Hence the long list of white folks on the rolls. Yeppers.","- Financial incentives

"For sure there are many tragic stories of this type, as the Indians for some reason resented the Euro-Americans moving in, taking over their lands and moving them out.  We grew up hearing about how the ""savages"" opposed our Manifest Destiny,  the heroics of the Cavalry, the struggles we had in the ""Winning of the West."" 

 In Oregon we have historic monuments to whites killed by Indians, such as the ""Jedediah Smith Massacre"" at Reedsport, the Geisel/Battle Rock monument at Port Orford, etc., but no highway  signage that I know of commemorating Native Americans massacred by whites.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms. What does it say about a civilized society that we would have to bleep a statement from the leading Republican candidate because he was being ""truthful""?

"No matter how hard democrats try to use tragedies to push for greater gun control , two facts always stand clear : gun control laws won't stop these mass killings and democrats don't understand this fact.   Everyone knows the real goal of democrats is to get every gun from every American .  They ask who needs an assault rifle ?  How about average American's who are faced with groups of thugs threatening to burn down home's and steal every time a court decision doesn't go their way ?  In Baltimore the pathetic mayor ordered police to stand down and allow thugs to blow off steam by destroying buildings and stealing everything they wanted. If law abiding people there had just one assault rifle per home or business---nothing would have been burned down or stolen or there would have been a hundred fewer thugs the next time the court decision didn't go their way.

"This woman is absolutely crazy.   Her Facebook is filled with obscenities and words of hate.  F this, F that, the F word is everywhere on her Facebook.  She appears to be an emotional basket case currently, posting rants almost every day about how miserable she is, and she states that she is drinking heavily.   One of her friends appears to have committed suicide recently, after shooting a woman.

I think that people in the Santa Clara area should stay well clear of her.   She is really messed up pretty bad.   Take a look:

"I wonder why so many liberals parents taught them to use name calling as a way to make themselves seem larger or their point stronger.   I don't mind that people disagree with me .  I just laugh at the way their brains are so small they think name calling makes them appear larger than they really are.  People who have to call others names do so because they don't know how to make their point any other way.   And it's just not me. Look how they called Sullivan names---Danny Boy , Ohio Dan and other names. It backfired.   For reasons only known to them liberals think name calling or intentional mis-spelling a name helps their causes when it doesn't . With the gay rights vote they called everyone bigots and homophobes and worse . They were leading in the polls until the naming calling---and they lost.

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives.

Does it really help the investigation after the crime is committed?  Are all of those who law enforcement have been watching pulled in for questioning?

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel.

"I love how white folks talk about how ""color"" is not a factor within the PPS system (you should surely know what it's like to experience systemic racism) and how the ""guise"" of political correctness is often confused with giving marginalized communities respect and recognizing the horrible history of inequity and oppression they've had to endure.

This muslim radical terrorist ""self identifies"" on facebook, phone calls, texting etc as such and tbe Administration / AG now redact and inexplicably try to dilute the hard facts-just like Beghazi et al.  Fact.  

The same Admin wants transgender rights for those that ""self identify"" as another sex and decry those questioning the slippery slope as bigots.  Fact.  

So what's in a phrase?  Hmm.  

The gay community is admirably and  understandably proactive in defending themselves-much like Israel on the world stage.  And owning a gun (or mace, taser, etc) is the best way to assuage the helplessness and mitigate a nightmare scenario that arrises from such tragic events.

"Please google what the word ""jesus"" means. 

The ONLY reason you people believe is because you are absolutely clueless as to what it is you even worship.

Try watching ""A history of God"" and educate yourself. It's a strictly neutral documentary from the BBC. I'd suggest watching it with a google window open on a handy device to fact check as you watch. 

I am 100% certain though every single one of you bible thumpers don't bother to even watch 5 minutes. Too much at stake if I am right and you are wrong huh?

This has nothing going to do with a “culture of victimhood,” whatever that means, and everything to do with the attempt to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim. The fact is, he’s wrong, as are you. Women, regardless of how their dressed, what they’ve drank, who they’ve previously had relations with, what part of town they happen to be in, or any other qualifier that used to be, and sadly still is, used, are never responsible for the crimes committed against them.

"Evangelicals ""panting desire for affirmation""---oh, Donny, oh, yes, yes, arrest those women ""bleeding out of their whatever""--which Trump is all too delighted to quench--does originate in their feelings of inferiority, feelings that have been successfully exploited for decades. Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.

She ordered tests when I needed them.  Never hesitated.

It still stands true however, that beginning 3 years ago, she changed.  The 'fake' physicals where we just chatted.  The concern I had over some new strange symptoms that scared me.  She said ""huh, that's not normal"" and then sent me on my way w/no information.  She'd changed.

That embassies in Yemen, Pakistan, Egypt and Tunisia were also attacked in response to the film?  The main difference between Benghazi and the other attacks is that the other attacks were all on hardened, purpose built facilities, while the Benghazi attack was on a non-hardened, leased, temporary facility.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.

After the sun set on the latter's bloody ""empire"" the US and USSR stepped in as the new puppet-masters.  The DIRECT result of their greedy manipulation is what we see now.

"Interesting that this professor feels that the candidate who endorses torture, banning Muslims, punishing women who have abortions, unilaterally starting new wars, et. etc. is the one who defends the Constitution.

Trump isn't Hitler.  Nor is he simply 'non-PC'.  Nor is he merely an ""amateur"".  No, he's woefully ignorant of how our constitutional republic is set up to operate.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it.

How is it a lower-class, uneducated mutt like myself can find over a billion in savings when our high-class, 70k + per year salaried Oilies in the Legislature can only find the Permanent Fund to Raid?

"i hate racism. i think it is obscene.  i think i t goes both ways.  that said -  there is a line crossed when it's people who are police that are targeted .  they are the people who DO put their lives on the line for the public.  the service the police provide the public  is by no means done fairly, equally, honorably, unbiased, without ulterior motives, altruistically, etc, etc.  some cops , on-duty cops,  exhibit every evil that exists in the world.   they are relative to the total, but a small number of cops  are just bad, some real bad - had one in the family.  but, as a job,  these ARE the people who show up when most others would run.  they DO protect.  they DO save lives.  targeting cops or targeting soldiers - just wrong. not to say they are top notch individuals, but as a group - they deserve respect. the shooter targeted a group - i'll bet not one cop killed had ever killed a black person - or  any person. eye for  an eye? not the answer.",Condemns targeting police as a group.,"Respect for Protectors, Not Perpetrators",Condemning Racism While Defending Police Honor,"Respect for Protectors, Condemning Racism and Violence

"The President goes on the air with a speech how the black people are not treated the same as White people. Do White people get preferential hiring and other entitlements, that Whites are not eligible for due to one single factor….. the color of their White skin? How is this treating everyone equal? obama has caused much more racism in America then any President that I have been around to witness. Things have gone backwards instead of getting better.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past. I'm an example of a successful survivor, but Brianna will never have that chance because someone brutally murdered her. Someone abused her - this time they killed her.  This young woman had her whole life ahead of her. She should still be alive.","

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
He later recounted ""I was relieved to see a white man.""
