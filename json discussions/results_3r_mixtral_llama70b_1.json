Answer: Drug Dealers don\u2019t allow them to use the loo; they\u2019re doing business. \n\nAllowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. \n\nIf you think I\u2019m an illiberal jerk, I\u2019ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  \n\nNow, it is time for Democrats to evolve.\n\nP.S.  Would you prefer a locked gate or armed guards?",

Direction of Bias: The code highlights the bias in law enforcement's response towards white groups, with harsher measures being taken despite their actions being characterized as less violent. In contrast, leniency is shown towards black individuals or movements like Black Lives Matter, despite the protests being largely non-violent.\n2. Power Dynamic: It's essential to acknowledge the power dynamic inherent in the relationship between law enforcement and the racial groups they serve. This code captures the perception that law enforcement holds more power and uses it unevenly when responding to civil unrest based on race.\n3. Specific Behaviors and Actions: To ensure clarity, the code should specify the different behaviors and actions exhibited by white and black groups during civil unrest. For instance, white groups might be characterized by their more violent actions, while black groups might be associated with peaceful protests or demonstrations.\n4. Systemic Racism: Incorporating the concept of systemic racism brings into focus the larger societal issues that influence and shape the perception of differential treatment by law enforcement. It highlights the historical and contemporary factors that contribute to racial bias in the justice system.\n\nThe refined code suggests the existence of a racial bias in law enforcement's response to civil unrest, with the potential for systemic racism to be a contributing factor.

I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. \n\nMoreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both. \n\nNow, Mr. Weinerman invokes the current chaos neighboring countries; chaos caused entirely by the American intervention in Iraq in 2003, as reason enough to hold on to what they took nearly 50 years ago.",

He also blocked environmental protection every chance he got.  He had nine children, which is selfish and irresponsible......he was probably opposed to birth control.

Both are being tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others for being hate groups, as well as being monitored by the Department of Homeland Security.  Both pose a real danger to the government and to members of law enforcement.   They are heavily armed, and often threaten violence.\n\nYou forget about all of the many reports that came out of Burns, of people being intimidated and threatened by the Malheur occupiers and their supporters.

These are extremist anti-government hate groups, and are no different than Islamic terrorists with regarding to the irrationality of their thinking.   Back on Feb 2nd, it was announced that the investigation into Finicum's shooting would not be done until early to mid March.   The investigation is being headed by the Deschutes County Sheriff's office, with assistance from the Bend and Redmond police departments.\n\nYet, you attempt to make some sort of anti-government conspiracy out of this investigation, when it is being handled normally according to established protocols.   You need to spend more time reading real news, and stop listening to all of the nonsense on these anti-government websites.\n\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/02/investigation_into_death_of_or.html",

That's a sin--mixing meat and dairy.  Not circumsized guys?  You're a sinner.  Work on Sunday?  Sinner.  (So...are religious leaders who are \"working\" leading their congregations on Sunday...wow, gets confusing.)  The litany of Old Testament things that the \"Good Book\" says is hilarious.  Just as hilarious as saying women aren't fit to lead--because the \"Good Book\" says so.  As Nathan might suggest, read Leviticus--it's an eye-opener.  And totally unrelated to the teachings of Jesus, the New Testament, since nowhere does he suggest women are second-class people. (Speaking of Jesus here, and not the misogynist Paul.)",

Combine the two codes to create a more comprehensive and specific code that captures both the idea of selective interpretation and its application to gender discrimination. For example, the code could be \"Selective Interpretation of Religious Texts for Gender Discrimination through Selective Literalism.\"\n2. If the analysis aims to explore biases and agendas beyond gender discrimination, then LLM-2's code \"Selective Literalism\" could be used as a broader, overarching code, with subcodes that specify the type of bias or agenda, such as \"Selective Literalism for Gender Discrimination,\" \"Selective Literalism for Racial Discrimination,\" etc.\n3. If the analysis focuses solely on gender discrimination, then LLM-1's code \"Selective Interpretation of Religious Texts for Gender Discrimination\" could be used as the primary code, with subcodes that specify the type of selective interpretation, such as \"Cherry-picking Biblical Rules for Gender Discrimination,\" \"Ignoring Contradictory Teachings for Gender Discrimination,\" etc.\n\nThese refinements aim to create codes that are more specific, comprehensive, and analytically useful for the research project.",

Introduce a hierarchical structure: To establish a hierarchical structure, we can break down the code further into sub-codes that capture different types of discrimination. For example, we can use \"Selective Interpretation of Religious Texts (Selective Literalism)\" as the main code, and then use sub-codes like \"Gender Discrimination,\" \"Racial Discrimination,\" \"Ethnic Discrimination,\" and so on, to specify the type of discrimination being analyzed.\n3. Develop a notation system: To make the codes more systematic and easy to use, we can develop a notation system. For example, the main code can be represented as \"S1,\" and the sub-codes can be represented as \"S1.1, S1.2, S1.3,\" and so on. This notation system will help us to quickly identify the code we are using and make it easier to analyze the data.\n4. Establish a framework for analysis: To ensure that the codes are used systematically and consistently, we can establish a framework for analysis. This framework can include a set of guidelines or instructions for applying the codes, as well as a process for reviewing and refining the codes during the analysis.\n5. Pilot-test and refine the codes: Once the codes and framework have been established, we can pilot-test them on a small sample of data to ensure that they are effective and easy to use.

I would like to see WWeek cover all the details of this case.  The free speech concerns are certainly valid, but they're only part of this story.  The other story here, the one they're not telling you, is about how our legal system (and IMO the local press) has failed to protect our community from this creep for over a dozen years.  Now, he's even found a way of manipulating the system for profit.  Is that not a story worthy of the fine journalists at WWeek?\n\nAnd if YOU think he's innocent, then maybe you'll explain why the jury dismissed the defamation and false light claims?  Maybe you'll explain the alternative motives of so many different women, who don't know each other, and who have bravely come forward with these accusations over many YEARS?

Plenty of people take that option because of their subconscious racism/sexism/etc... From a libertarian perspective (one I've heard from libertarians, I'm not a libertarian myself), people who do not take diversity into account are robbing their businesses/organizations/bureaus of the success those varied backgrounds can provide - only thoroughly tapping the potential of about 43% of the population. \nFrom my own perspective (socialist-ish), a lot of personal \"baggage\" comes from my heritage (specifically from shit white people have done to my ancestors), and I ask for distributive justice.

And many of them were whites since white inmates still make up the majority of the prison population. It just isn't about the natives as Mr. Wohlforth like you to think. Question should be, why are some witnesses, regardless of their ethnic background, disbelieved? This isn't just a native problem, its may be a problem for all ethnic backgrounds. There were plenty of witnesses when Ms. Ellis ran over Mr. Dusenbury, and most of them were white folks. Why did DA Campion dismissed them? Mr. Wohlforth is picking and choosing his cases to fit his profile of a racist Alaska criminal justice system but that is a lie. Whites, Asians, Hispanics and Blacks witnesses were often causally dismissed out of hand as any native ones.",

It might be beneficial to explicitly define what is meant by \"selective\" in each context to ensure clarity and precision in the codes.\n\n3. **Inclusion of the Concept of Narrative**: LLM-2's code incorporates the idea of a \"narrative,\" which suggests that the way stories or cases are presented can influence perceptions of justice and belief in witnesses.

They miss their responsibility for creating the conditions that make for a rich soup of angry people who don't see any way out.  Of course we all know that the Iraqi war was the worst response, particular how the first six months were handled. Bush's team was arrogant. Blackwater was arrogant.  Debathification was stupid, and arrogant.  They left stock piles of bombs around Bagdad that slowly dissolved to become IEDs. And throughout this the words of support for Islam were undermined by the radical right.  And it's gotten worse, much worse as Fox and team rally their troops to undermine considered actions that could both reduce the hatred and tension and increase our ability to deal with extremists on both ends...great insights!",

The name of the restaurant signifies nothing more than a seasoning, and food from a specific era, but it is a catchy title. Should we all boycott McDonald's because the name sounds Scottish but they don't serve Scottish food? How about Subway, their food has nothing to do with underground transportation. Does the name Texas Roadhouse offend Texans? See where I'm going with this. It is just too much! If the name bugs you that much, don't eat there, and stay out of it. The owner doesn't want to force their beliefs on you or erase your culture. They just want to feed you. How about we find something important to get upset over?",

I think we should ban those proxy slave owners from--from--well, whatever they need banning from on the off chance GGG-Grandpa held slaves.  Or how about this--since British colonialism in India seems to have struck a chord, is there any chance these folks are storing away some energy for protesting India's home-grown caste system--which still exists, by the way?

It maintains the core of sarcasm and incredulity found in the original critique.\n\n**Refinement Suggestions:**\n\n- **Combining Elements**: A refined code could combine the clarity of \"Sarcastic Critique\" with the focus on \"Ironical Hypocrisy Exposure\". For example, **\"Sarcastic Exposure of Hypocrisy\"** could encapsulate both the tone (sarcastic) and the action (exposure of hypocrisy) effectively.\n\n- **Precision in Scope**: To further refine, consider adding a hint about the context or the specific issues being addressed (e.g., historical oppression, selective outrage). This could make the code more informative without losing conciseness. For instance, **\"Sarcastic Critique of Selective Moral Outrage\"**.\n\n- **Tone and Intent**: Both codes effectively convey a mocking and incredulous tone. Ensuring that any refined code retains this aspect is crucial, as it's central to understanding the commentator's intent.\n\n- **Qualitative vs. Quantitative**: If these codes are part of a larger qualitative analysis, ensuring they align with or complement other codes in the study is essential. For quantitative studies, these codes might need to be more categorical and less interpretive.\n\n**Proposed Refined Code:**\n\nConsidering the suggestions, a potentially refined code could be **\"Sarcastic Exposure of Historical Hypocrisy\"**. This maintains the essence of both original codes, emphasizing the sarcastic tone and the focus on exposing hypocrisy, particularly in the context of historical issues like slavery and colonialism. \n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Validate the refined code against the original text to ensure it accurately captures the essence.\n- Consider peer review or another round of collaborative refinement to solidify the code's applicability and clarity.\n- Ensure the code aligns with the broader research context and methodology.",

This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations.

(BTW: It's not unusual for persons who have taken Chapter 7, to, when they have the funds, repay those persons they listed in the Bankruptcy......that's a truly \"manly\" thing to do.....Trump boasts of his billions, but hasn't done so), Is it manly to, when your wife ages, trade her in for the new \"model\"?
