"amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject  covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe.",Misunderstanding of mother's work amidst changing perspectives on tobacco use,Defensive Pride,Overlooked Contributions to Workplace Safety Amid Tobacco Industry Scrutiny,Defending maternal legacy against tobacco stigma,Defense of Mother's Legacy vs. Tobacco Demonization,Defending Mother's Legacy in Workplace Safety amid Tobacco Industry Contention,"**Qualitative Codes:**

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]  

Frankly, I'm at a complete loss as to why you are so determined to contradict our historians,  the NAACP at  the Mims etc. on this.

To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman. I would like to hear from girls dressing as boys and see if they feel equal amongst the boys.

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!  No tar and feathering, no running out on a rail, no lynchings (though I think I do vaguely remember reading about the possibility of a mock lynching).

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

Remember, this is the word of God.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

"Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…). 
With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.
You may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls. Aren't you outraged?
Same with Jews: intermarriage is frowned upon, though, unlike Catholics, a woman really can't become a Jew in traditional sense.",Affirmation of racial pride and unity amidst historical and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; emphasizes importance of law-abiding behavior and cultural preservation.,Racial Harmony vs. Societal Constraints,Identity and Interracial Dynamics Across Cultures,**Code: Social and Cultural Dynamics of Interracial Relationships and Community Standards**,"**Racial & Religious Boundaries**

This code captures the comment's focus on historical and ongoing societal pressures regarding race and religion, specifically:

* **Interracial relationships:** The comment highlights past dangers faced by black men in relationships with white women and connects it to the Black is Beautiful movement. 
* **Social Control and Identity:** It points to the impact of drug-related issues and incarceration on Black identity, contrasting it with the strict rules and boundaries within some religious communities.
* **Comparison of Religious Practices:** The comment draws a parallel between restrictions on intermarriage within Catholicism and Judaism, raising questions about religious exclusivity and potential hypocrisy.

"Transgender is such a small segment of the population but somehow has commanded and demanded that the majority bow to their demands. I don't want to share a restroom with someone of a different gender, doesn't matter if the person identifies with my gender or not. It's not about being 'transgender'. You were born with certain parts. That's just how it is. If you want to get a sex change operation, then fine. Once changed, you are then that other sex and you should then use that restroom because you then have those parts. That's why men's restrooms have urinals, and women's don't. It's about the parts. 

But if you want to act like a woman (or man) but not change your parts, well, you're still a woman (or man). That's just reality. And no matter which sex you identify with, your parts are still those parts. Your needs are no more important than mine. Why should a majority of people be forced to follow what a minority wants?

"There you go, stay the course. It is your hatred/machismo combination that gained you a following by others who hate and appreciate you talking tough and hateful.

The issue here is the whole world is disturbed by Trump's hatred, forget about what the GOP thinks- they have never been concerned what Americans actually think. In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump. The GOP card has been about hate long before Trump- how about: women can't control their own womb, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more coroporation rights than individual rights, problems with what room you go to the bathroom in, who you marry. The racism and hate has always been not far from the GOP, mimicking the traditionally racist south on voting lines. Also no coincidence, it is the vastly undereducated that support the GOP...anyone with an education can see nothing but hate/corporate profiteering and little else.

"This is one of those topics no one wants to touch.  If you say ""hold on a second, sometimes they are drunk (not passed out), consent and are happy to consent, but afterwards regret it: then they were sexually assaulted""...now you get bashed for ""supporting sexual victimization.""  And if you flat out support it, well what about the other shoe: ""both Mike and Jill were drunk.  Mike and Jill had sex.  Jill was drunk: so Mike sexually assaulted her.""  Well...Mike was drunk also...so couldn't it be that Jill assaulted him??  Why is it only one way.

I've personally seen on the UAF campus a woman claim she was raped after she had sex with a male.  Multiple times even.  But the male student wasn't interested in dating, and after she realized this she was overheard saying she was ""raped"" for their sexual encounters.

"Alaska being so remote and known as the Last Frontier seems to  receive it’s share of deranged folks who seem to think they can escape their problems from back home.

Remember the loners who came up here to places like McCarthy or say Manley Hot Springs. These same minded  like folks then took it to the extreme and ended up murdering scores of innocent people in those communities. Then we have those who kill maybe one or two, all because of being sick minded losers who prey on those who cannot defend themselves. This story ended up on a positive note, lucky for this guy.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.

"On the one hand, Sanders' supporters are so ideologically pure they rub salt in their own wounds while other ""Dems"" are ""pure"" but in a different way because they're supposedly ""above"" politics (former independents, so are they REALLY Democrats anyway ?) might be willing to throw THEMSELVES under a bus by voting for Trump and his bondage hostage, the Republican party (it's gonna get kinky!), so Dems will likely have to bank on demographics and Don to help them to victory.

"Class? Republicans are not a ""class"" properly speaking but rather members of the Republican party or voters who vote Republican. Just as Democrats are not socio-economically homogenous, neither are Republicans.
As for shame, reasonable people don't expect cretins to have any which is why Mr. Bahr's letter is so perplexing. I suspect he doesn't have a sense of humor since Trump is obviously supremely ludicrous if in a ""sick humor"" sort of way. Let's face it, he makes all Americans look pretty stupid. But he really is a perfect fit for the Republican party, a sort of culmination of sorts of their years of smoking political crack. 
Are Republicans scary? Obviously.  White ghouls always are but instead of them getting a rope and wildly looking for a black man any black man, they're coalescing around a guy that's going to drive their party into the ground.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case.

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)???

"I thought the original subject was Muslims killing people here in the US.   But I did bring up the Saudi's because you seem to think the anti-homosexual bias is some ancient no longer applicable belief.  You are wrong; if you go to Saudi Arabia and practice homosexuality, you would be DEAD wrong.   

As an agnostic, I think all these religions are merely another tool for egotistical  people to exercise power over those who they convince that their 'religion' has some validity.

I don't think you really have the same view of Islam that I learned from practicing Muslims from both Sunni and Shi'a backgrounds.  They believe.  Islam is the Submission to Allah!  To deny any of  the teachings is to be apostate.  What Muhammed said centuries ago is not 'old testament' stuff.  It is The Word Of God!  To deny anything Mohammed said is punishable by death.

"In 2013, firearms were used in 84,258 nonfatal injuries (26.65 per 100,000 U.S. citizens)  and 11,208 deaths by homicide (3.5 per 100,000), 21,175 by suicide with a firearm, 505 deaths due to accidental discharge of a firearm, and 281 deaths due to firearms-use with ""undetermined intent"" for a total of 33,169 deaths related to firearms (excluding firearm deaths due to legal intervention). 1.3% of all deaths in the country were related to firearms.

So should we be more worried about nutcase U.S.-born Muslims, or the proliferation of firearms?  Should we go along with the NRA's victories to keep us from being protected from lunatics acquiring guns, domestic violence criminals from getting AK-47s, or children under five picking up guns and killing their siblings or friends? The NRA was even able to keep explosives used in domestic terrorism from being tagged so law enforcement could track those vendors who were supplying bombers.",Firearm regulation failure and impact on violence,GunControlVsFearMongering,**Code:** Firearm Proliferation and NRA Influence,**Firearm-Related Violence and Advocacy Constraints**,**NRA Power & Gun Violence**,"1. **NRA Influence on Firearm Violence**

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

"Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"".

* Avoid Judgement: Phrases like Intolerance in Islam vs. Compassion in Christianity can be perceived as value judgments. Religious teachings are complex and often subject to diverse interpretations within each faith. Strive for neutrality by focusing on perceptions and interpretations rather than definitive statements about which religion is more or less tolerant.
* Specificity: While comparative religious teachings on homosexuality is a good start, consider being more specific about the aspects of those teachings being compared. For example, are they comparing scripts, laws, or societal practices?
* Context: Remember that this code is likely part of a larger analysis. Consider if other codes in that analysis might need to be adjusted for consistency and clarity.

**Specific Refinement Suggestions:**

* LLM-1's Code:  
    * LGBTQ+ Rights, Religious Tolerance, and Interpretations of Sacred Texts: A Comparative Analysis of Christian and Islamic Perspectives This is a strong code because it:
        * Highlights interpretations of sacred texts and specifies LGBTQ+ rights

* LLM-4 & LLM-s:

Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American.  As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home.  Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act.  ISIS announced an attack 3 days before.  Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic.  These are the storyline so far.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings. Sexual assault is a horrendous crime against any human, however it is my opinion the term Rape Culture is nonsense and the statement the absence of a no is not consent is just feminist garbage. If you want people to listen to you lose the silly slogans. The problems we are dealing with in our society are breakdown of families, lack of respect for others, lack of self respect and there are too many kids in college that should be digging ditches or learning a trade.  Society has glamorized the beer guzzling and hook ups. Women will be women and men will be men, or whatever you decide to identify as on any given day of the week.

"Reading the article gave me hope for an even handed portrayal of the reactions to this horrific event. It started out in just that way, then veered into a subtle and not so subtle jab at those who are conservative/republican.
In a number of articles about the shooting and reaction to it, many comment about the hate that seems to be on display about all manner of aspects to the reaction to the shooting. 
There is one aspect to the hate that is being displayed that is not addressed. There is the hate for gays mentioned, hate for Muslims mentioned, hate for different races mentioned, etc. The one hate on prominent display but not mentioned is the hate for anyone or anything conservative.

"So, by that token you have studied history and are fully aware of the terror, torture, empire building, murders, and subjugation that the christians have wrought on the world as well.

**Code-Specific Suggestions:**

1. **Belief that Islamophobia stems from radicalism and Quranic teachings used to justify violence.**  
    * **Suggestion:** Consider making it more neutral, as it assumes the commenter's belief is accurate. Something like Perception that Islamophobia is fueled by radicalism and violent interpretations of Quranic teachings might be better.

2. **Fear and opposition to Islam, with a focus on self-defense.** 
    * This is good! Maybe consider adding including perceived threats to ... [national security, cultural values, etc.] to specify what kind of threats are perceived.

3. **View of Islam as a powerful and manipulative political entity.**
    * **Suggestion:** This code is accurate but could be strengthened. Think about adding: ...working to undermine [existing social order, individual liberties, etc.]

4. **Justification of Islamophobia based on fear of radicalization and need for protection.**
    * This one is very strong! It captures the core logic of the comment.

5. **Concern about Islam's radicalizing influence through its religious texts.**
    * **Suggestion:** Consider making this more nuanced. Perhaps something like: Belief that certain interpretations of Quranic teachings promote radicalization would better reflect the commenter's specific concern about interpretations rather than the entire text.

**Beyond the Codes:**

* **Context:** Where did this comment come from? What is the broader conversation? This can shed light on motivations and influences.
* **Language:** Pay attention to word choice, tone, and emotional language. These can reveal underlying attitudes and biases.

What we need is a plan of action to deal with the mentally ill because the current approach is simply not working.  You seem to think that all we need to do is give them medication, home and a job. That is naïve at best, stupid at worst.  Mental health is a life time illness so we need a long term plan. And yes, hospitalization must be part of the plan. I dare any mental health clinian out there who claims that he can come up with a medication in a 15 minutes session. It usually requires weeks to come up with what works for just one patient.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again. And they will. Editorials like this are foolish and irresponsible responses to radical Islam.","Misplaced Focus on Tools, Not Root Causes","Gun Violence Denied: Radical Islam Blamed

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape. RAINN argues that removing the impediments to reporting and convicting rapists is the key to reducing rape rates, not lectures and false assertions.","- Raising awareness about rape culture

* **Racial bias:** This is a central issue, affecting Native American families disproportionately.
* **Misinformation:** The comment challenges the misrepresentation of FASD and related issues.
* **Systemic injustice:** The foster care system itself is implicated in perpetuating these issues.
* **Advocacy for change:** The user is actively seeking to promote accuracy and fairness.

**Refinement Suggestions:**

* **Specificity:**

  * Instead of just child welfare, consider foster care system or child protection services for greater clarity.
* **Action Orientation:**  

  * Words like exposing, challenging, demanding, or reforming can emphasize the call for action.
* **Emotional Resonance:**

  * Perpetuating bias, ignoring injustice, or demanding truth can add weight to the statement.

* **Conciseness:** Aim for a code that is memorable and impactful.

**Possible Refined Codes (Building on Existing Suggestions):**

* **Exposing Racial Bias & Misinformation in Foster Care: Advocating for Equity & Justice.**
* **Challenging Injustice: Reclaiming Accuracy in Foster Care for Native Families.** 
* **Reforming Foster Care to Combat Racial Bias & Address FASD Misinformation.**
* **Demanding Truth & Equity: Uncovering Racial Bias in the Foster Care System.** 

**Choosing the Best Code:**

The ideal code depends on the context and desired impact. Consider:

* **Audience:** Who will be reading this code (researchers, advocates, the general public)?  
* **Purpose:** Is it for a presentation, an article, or a social media campaign?

"Bill Clinton's economic conservatism did not occur in a vacuum. You will recall Newt Gingrich's ""Contract with America"" and the fact that Republicans obtained a majority in Congress in 1994. Obama is also an economically conservative Democrat and also faced a Republican majority in the House.

With the Republicans, you've got a range from ""weapons of mass destruction"" Dick Chaney to ""deport all the Mexicans and Muslims"" Donald Trump and their followers range from misogynist Christians to knuckle dragging white supremacists.

"And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color. Using a majority white, relatively crime free population stat to silence the experiences of brown people is a pretty standard way of keeping people of color on the fringes of the reality you and Tyler Hurst live.

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.

I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

"Google Mussolini for the visage and orations of the original ""Trump"".  Just add hair and the arrogant stance and pose is almost identical.  The Italian Mussolini was the real creator of Fascism.  Hitler's Nazism just expanded it to include full German military might and demonizing of Jews to provide a scapegoat justifying genocide and continental conquest.  Germans were just more efficient than the Italians.  Mussolini(Il Duce) is the perfect ancestor of the One-Man rule arrogantly expounded by Trump.

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms. What does it say about a civilized society that we would have to bleep a statement from the leading Republican candidate because he was being ""truthful""?
For example, ""shit"" ""ass"" ""schlonged"" ""fuck"" ""bullshit"" ""fat ass"" ""bastard"" ""crap"" and ""motherfuckers"". 
People might say ""he won't do this as President"". He is just getting free media attention"" or ""he doesn't mean it"".  But all I have to go on is how people act. That's the best resume for president.

"""Yep, 21,175 people committed suicide with a firearm and not one gun ban would have prevented their choice to commit suicide. "" Quote Ms. Kearon
Want can one say about such an ignorant statement, many citizens are driven to make that choice of suicide for many reasons. Some are mentally ill and need help. Studies that have been done on suicide is that if guns are not at hand and one has to go out of there way to obtain one  that the person who may be intent on ending their own life has enough of a ""grace"" period to not do the deed.  How can you speak so freely about so many dead Americans by gun annually like it is collateral damage to the Gods Of Guns? So you state the dead by gun and do you have a solution to the violence in this nation other then to it can't be prevented and all the people who die that it is their fault, when you don't even know these people.

"Tell me what you hunt with your modern sporting rifle? That is in fact the civillian version of the M-16. And what was the M-16 designed to do ...oh yes kill people.

You say a single man is to blame...okay take away the gun he used and how many people could he have killed? Seems as though the gun may have helped quite a bit...Omar Mateen running up and yelling BANG! probably wouldn't have killed too many of the club goers.  It had little or nothing to do with religion...many a person has pledged allegiance to the American flag their whole lives, prior to killing innocent people and we don't talk about how they are radical Christian American terrorists now do we?

How about average American's who are faced with groups of thugs threatening to burn down home's and steal every time a court decision doesn't go their way ?  In Baltimore the pathetic mayor ordered police to stand down and allow thugs to blow off steam by destroying buildings and stealing everything they wanted. If law abiding people there had just one assault rifle per home or business---nothing would have been burned down or stolen or there would have been a hundred fewer thugs the next time the court decision didn't go their way.

2. Ineffectiveness of Ad Hominem Attacks as a Debate Tactic","**Strong Options:**

* **Name-Calling: A Self-Defeating Debate Tactic (LLM-1):** This option is concise and impactful. It highlights the inherent flaw in using name-calling, emphasizing that it ultimately hurts the user's position rather than strengthening it. 
* **Name-Calling: A Sign of Intellectual Weakness (LLM-2, revised):** This code effectively conveys the underlying rationale behind the user's sentiment. It directly links name-calling to a lack of intellectual depth and the inability to engage in reasoned argumentation.

**Considerations for Refinement:**

* **Specificity:** While Ineffectiveness of Ad Hominem Attacks (LLM-3, revised) accurately captures the logical fallacy, it might be too general. We could consider specifying the context more clearly, such as Ineffectiveness of Ad Hominem Attacks in Political Discourse.

**Final Thoughts:**

The choice between the final codes depends on the specific emphasis you want to place.  

* If you want to highlight the counterproductive nature of name-calling, then **Name-Calling: A Self-Defeating Debate Tactic** is a strong choice.  
* If you want to emphasize the intellectual weakness it reveals, then **Name-Calling: A Sign of Intellectual Weakness** is more fitting.","1. Name-Calling as a Substitute for Stronger Arguments

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives. Statistics and facts. Just like when you say that black on black crime is what kills the most you are called a racist.

* **Accuracy:** Most codes accurately capture the commenter's core sentiment: frustration with the justice system and its perceived leniency, leading to a desire for harsher punishments. 
* **Neutrality:** Some codes lean towards judgment (e.g., Victim Blaming). While the commenter does express these views, using more neutral language focuses on the *commenter's perspective* rather than labeling them.

* **LLM-1's Suggestion:**

* **LLM-2's Refinement:**  

> Incorporating the theme of **blame shifting.**

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel.

Why are you appalled when a disenfranchised community decides to take a larger role in the education of their children in order to address disparities and inequities?

"Evangelicals ""panting desire for affirmation""---oh, Donny, oh, yes, yes, arrest those women ""bleeding out of their whatever""--which Trump is all too delighted to quench--does originate in their feelings of inferiority, feelings that have been successfully exploited for decades. Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.

"Having police go to homes to forcibly disarm Americans in Hawaii is going to raise death by firearms for the police and people who are said to be too sick to have guns. 
Also no gun owner will go seek mental health if they know the police will come and take their guns.
Most mass murders in the US have not been diagnosed with serious mental health conditions.
Registering all firearms with the Federal government will stimulate the Militias and Hate groups most dire prediction to their followers; the government wants your guns so they can take away your freedom.

People raised in poverty and are racially and/or culturally deprived, live in a parallel universe that's ugly, dog-eat-dog and cannot even relate to the demands of the dominant white culture, which the police generally represent.  We, as a society, have to admit and OWN the horrendous dysfunction of our racially and economically stratified culture. Our enforced ""wall-in, wall out"" system has produced the highest incarceration rate of any advanced country on the planet.  And blacks and latinos are far, far over-represented in that population.

If you have children, have they ever disobeyed you? Did you kill them? That is what Leviticus calls for.
Have you ever eaten pork? Touched a pig or anything made from a pig? Abomination.

Liberals lead the charge in their efforts to take away everyone's guns to save lives , yet lead they the same charge to kill the most defenseless among us.  The nation mourns 49 innocent people killed in Orlando , yet half the nation celebrates women's right to kill the nearly born babies on demand. We are pulling our hair out trying to figure out how to stop that one nut in 100 million who might be the next mass killer----yet the mass killers are in every town across America---they are our girls and women.  Abortions kill innocent tens of thousands every year in America.  We think of all women as compassionate , when in reality---they are the mass killers we should fear the most. The stats don't lie .

"Technically, there are other inferences to a HIGHER POWERS.   But only four times is there any reference at all — “Laws of Nature and of NATURE'S God,” “Supreme Judge of the world,” “their Creator,” and “divine Providence” — and in all four cases the references to a higher power appeal to the idea of human dignity, never implying a role for a god in government. 

There are NUMEROUS references to what they also believed and put forth: FREEDOM to choose, NOT ONE RELIGION.

It upsets me when I hear about Christians making bad choices like that, it doesn't really represent the Christian community well, it's not kid friendly, and you can't share the love of our Lord and Savior Jesus by screaming hate and hell speech ugh! And I wouldn't want my kids seeing some dude running around in chaps and a thong. Butts, boobs and whatever else should be for adults not kids.  I wouldn't let my kids look at anyone running around showing their ass lol  Anyway everyone is allowed to make their own choices, some choose to be hateful, some choose to be almost naked, some choose to show their kids adult situations.

"Thank you Elizabeth for your well written letter.  I blame our regulators.  The AMA approved the sale.  Shame on them.  Shame on Trillium.  Unfortunately, no amount of disgust, sorrow and frustration will change anything.  I posted yesterday my doctors name and her husband.  They've got their million.  I love my doctor and I'm sorry I failed in my now deleted post to express that.  I'd been w/Dr Mary Pugsley for many years and she always, always made me feel like she really cared.  She listened.  She ordered tests when I needed them.  Never hesitated.

It still stands true however, that beginning 3 years ago, she changed.  The 'fake' physicals where we just chatted.  The concern I had over some new strange symptoms that scared me.  She said ""huh, that's not normal"" and then sent me on my way w/no information.  She'd changed.  
I'm a good person.  I felt dismissed.  Now?  Learning all of this?  I'm ashamed.  Of her, I feel stupid now thinking it was my fault.

"What lies did Clinton tell about the attack?  Are you referring to the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" being blamed?  Are you aware that no less authority on the attacks than Ahmed Abu Khattala, the leader of Ansar al-Shariah (the group that carried out the attack) has stated that the attack was in retaliation for the film?  That embassies in Yemen, Pakistan, Egypt and Tunisia were also attacked in response to the film?  The main difference between Benghazi and the other attacks is that the other attacks were all on hardened, purpose built facilities, while the Benghazi attack was on a non-hardened, leased, temporary facility.  The deaths in Benghazi had nothing to do with Clinton, but rather with the office of Diplomatic Security failing to properly harden the building (and with congress failing to provide funding so that they could).",Misplaced blame for embassy attacks; focus on building security and funding,"Exonerating Clinton, Blaming Security Failures",**Code: Retaliation Narrative and Security Lapses**,The qualitative code from the response is: Benghazi Attack Justification.,"**Conspiracy Rejected, Blame Shifted**","1.

"I don't think that anyone needs to ""control"" Trump.

I heart demographic change!
We should all just sit back and enjoy this truly American reality/comedy show while it lasts. Americans have made excuses for the Right for a long time because they have mostly been harming women and America's misogynist core runs deep.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

Walker claims the state can't survive without our PFD yet months ago he wrote a check to Canada for 65 million . Now he wants to put us on the hook for billions for this gas line pie in the sky that doesn't pencil out.      The fact of the matter is all the polling showed Walker would lose again in the primary to Parnell---that's why he turned independent. The polling showed the democrats had zero chance of winning---that's why they quit .   Simply put---Alaskan's didn't want Walker .

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.  

Some high-ranking defectors aside, the Republicans will rally behind Trump because it's all they can do.  He is likely to lose, after which they will blame him, not themselves. So it goes.","- Historical precedent of party defection

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

* **Consider Perceived Threat and Justification for Lethal Force**: Emphasizing the perceived threat upfront might be slightly more neutral, acknowledging that the justification is based on a subjective assessment rather than an objective fact.

**Sub-Code:**

* **Racial Biases in Public Discourse**: Using biases instead of implications might be stronger, suggesting a more direct influence of race rather than just a potential factor.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Context Matters:** The specific wording of the comment will ultimately determine the most accurate codes. A slight shift in wording could necessitate a slight adjustment.
* **Further Sub-Coding:** Explore sub-codes within Racial Biases in Public Discourse to capture specific types of biases (e.g., implicit bias, explicit bias, systemic bias) or to identify the targets of these biases (e.g., police officers, the individual shot, both).

"Metooist:  You raise the key questions relating to religions.  Is god (or God), if he,she, it or they exist, loving or vengeful,  kind or rather nasty?  How about folks who pray to god (God) for rather petty things....victory in a football game for example.....would a god(God) really be interested in such matters?  As we look around us at the harm being done in the name of various gods(Gods), would any supreme being really want such actions?  The list of rather depressing questions could go on for pages.  I've met very loving, wonderful people of all religions.  I've met very loving, wonderful people who are athiests or agnostics.  I've met really nasty, hateful people who are self-avowed Christians, and, again, I've met nasty, hateful people who are agnostics or athiests.  How about radical Muslim zealots.....not really nice folks.  Yet, the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful individuals.  Good is done in the name of religion...so is evil.

"This is a sad day when innocent lives are lost during a police encounter. Its a sad day when our police are targeted and killed because of some very bad decisions by the few. This is getting out of control. Stop this madness. BLM needs to focus also on making blacks lives better not rail against all police. We as a nation know so many crimes are committed by blacks, even blacks on blacks, i.e Chicago? Non blacks are leery of blacks already because of this bad behavior because a large percentage of crimes are committed by them. Personally, I despise the white trash criminal even more. Either way, let justice prevail for officers who make very bad decisions, and yes we need to all come together to understand each other and respect each other.

"No matter the eventual reasoning that may come to light, I won't believe it. Some people simply want to hurt, and destroy, and kill, and will convince themselves of whatever they need in order to feel justified. Black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by the police than I, and though there are many reasons for the discrepancy the fact remains that's a horrific statistic that needs to be dealt with. However there's no way you're going to convince me that shooting a bunch of random family men in the back is any way forwards.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum","Escalating cycle of fear, distrust, and anger driven by incidents of violence and polarization.",Escalating Cycle of Fear and Violence,Cycle of Violence and Fear: Escalating Conflict and Distrust,Escalating Violence and Distrust,**Escalating Cycle of Violence & Fear**,"Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust","Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust","**Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust**","Escalating Cycle of Violence, Fear, and Distrust","**Qualitative Code:**

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it. But as I noted above, Financial Facts I pulled up just using the back of an envelope and 30 minutes show 1 Billion + in savings can be had without touching the PFD, without any new taxes, and without even touching SB21 or the Oil tax Credits. I could do a lot better with a copy of the actual budget in hand. How is it a lower-class, uneducated mutt like myself can find over a billion in savings when our high-class, 70k + per year salaried Oilies in the Legislature can only find the Permanent Fund to Raid?

If the Legislature REALLY wants the people behind it, they need to process all the savings I noted, restructure SB21, and *eliminate*, not DEFER, most of the Tax Credits. Then people will start getting behind more ideas on raising revenues.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past. I'm an example of a successful survivor, but Brianna will never have that chance because someone brutally murdered her. Someone abused her - this time they killed her.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else? 

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

2. **Perceived hypocrisy and divisiveness**: LLM-1's code (Perceived hypocrisy and prioritization of intra-racial violence over inter-racial violence within Black Lives Matter movement) and my code (Critique of BLM's priorities) touch on this aspect. We can distill this theme to create a more concise code.

* **Anti-BLM Narrative: Perceived Racism and Inconsistency**

LLM-3: I agree with the refined codes provided by LLM-2. To further enhance them, I suggest considering the following aspects:

* **Specificity**: Ensure the codes are specific enough to convey the unique themes and criticisms in the comment.
* **Brevity**: Strive for concise codes that are easy to understand and remember.
* **Neutrality**: Maintain a neutral tone in the codes to avoid introducing bias or emotional language.

With these considerations in mind, I propose the following additional refinements:

* **BLM Critique: Hypocrisy and Inconsistency**
* **Skepticism of BLM's Motives and Impact**
* **Anti-BLM Sentiment: Racism and Division**

LLM-4: Building on the refinements provided by LLM-2 and LLM-3, I recommend the following:

* **BLM Authenticity and Effectiveness**: This code focuses on the commentator's skepticism regarding BLM's genuine commitment to addressing racial issues and its actual impact.
* **Perceived Hypocrisy in BLM's Agenda**: This code highlights the commentator's criticism of BLM's priorities and alleged inconsistency in addressing different forms of violence.
* **Anti-BLM Perspective: Racism and Inequality**: This code captures the commentator's-negative view of BLM, perceiving it as promoting racism and division rather than unity and equality.

* **BLM Skepticism**: This code encapsulates the commentator's overall skepticism regarding BLM's authenticity, motives, and impact.
* **Hypocrisy and Inconsistency in BLM's Agenda**: This code specifically addresses the commentator's criticism of BLM's priorities and alleged inconsistency in addressing different forms of violence.

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

"Bogus statistic, More white men are shot and killed by police than are black men in the country. Facts are such a pesky thing. Of course, if you are talking about all categories of shootings and talking about Chicago, then I stand corrected. BLM say that they are non violent and just want to have an honest dialogue and get the problems out in the open so that they can be solved. Then how about addressing the dishonest statistics they cite, how about addressing the way that young blacks respond to any question by a police officer or request by an officer? I was raised on the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Or put another way, approach determines response.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else?

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

"""Of course all lives should matter and the point made by BLM is that they should matter too, not more"".   Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM. What red, yellow, white and brown skinned people hear clearly...is that Black Lives Matter more and are therefore more valued. So how do you explain BLM to the Korean Americans angered by police killing of a young male.  La Habra police were too quick to shoot in New Year's Eve incident, critics say. A young man killed for alledged vandalism with a tire iron but no weapon. A young man of YELLOW skinned pigmentation. Isn't it less damning to say ALL Lives matter and not single out  Blacks.

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
He later recounted ""I was relieved to see a white man."" 

And from where does such an ingrained response stem from? 
A history of a much higher crime rate among African-Americans.

* **LLM-1:** Consider: Implicit Threat Perception Bias in Policing, Influenced by Historical Crime Narratives
* **LLM-2:** Consider: Implicit Bias in Police Decision-Making, Shaped by Historical Crime Narratives
* **LLM-3:** Consider: Implicit Racial Bias in Threat Assessment Driven by Historical Crime Perceptions
* **LLM-4:** Consider: Implicit Racial Bias in Policing: Historical Crime Data Shaping Officer Responses
