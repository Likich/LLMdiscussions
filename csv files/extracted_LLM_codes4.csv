"amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject  covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe.",Dismissal of mother's advocacy due to tobacco industry misconceptions,DEFENSIVE VALIDATION OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,Maternal Advocacy Amidst Opposition,Misconstrued Maternal Advocacy in Workplace Safety,"- DEFENSIVE VALIDATION OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]  

Frankly, I'm at a complete loss as to why you are so determined to contradict our historians,  the NAACP at  the Mims etc. on this.

To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman.

Unless the author is accusing these people of racist behavior, why is this statement in the article? The author could have easily used Barack Obama's name instead of his preferred racial identity.

""...Jerad and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian and also died in a Las Vegas shooting rampage.""

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!

Description: This code encapsulates two distinct but interconnected themes. First, it addresses the contrast between perceived and actual racism in Oregon's history, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation of historical narratives in the face of evidence. Second, it explores the dual nature of social media's impact on teenagers' mental health, highlighting both the potential for increased anxiety and depression and the provision of community support. By examining these two themes through a nuanced and evidence-based lens, this code promotes a comprehensive understanding of the historical and social factors that influence racism and mental health.

Cross-cutting Themes:
- Critical evaluation of historical narratives
- Contrast between perception and evidence
- Dual impact of social media on mental health
- Anxiety and depression
- Community support provision

This final agreed qualitative code focuses on the importance of examining historical narratives and social media's impact on mental health through a nuanced, evidence-based approach.

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.

"Alaska being so remote and known as the Last Frontier seems to  receive it’s share of deranged folks who seem to think they can escape their problems from back home.  This is so typical of folks coming up here to  “live out their adventure or dream”  and as it happens  quite often, it becomes a nightmare.  Remember the loners who came up here to places like McCarthy or say Manley Hot Springs. These same minded  like folks then took it to the extreme and ended up murdering scores of innocent people in those communities. Then we have those who kill maybe one or two, all because of being sick minded losers who prey on those who cannot defend themselves. This story ended up on a positive note, lucky for this guy.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.
Don't think O'Connor doesn't assume (just like you) the wise old man and wise old woman are white.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

"In 2013, firearms were used in 84,258 nonfatal injuries (26.65 per 100,000 U.S. citizens)  and 11,208 deaths by homicide (3.5 per 100,000), 21,175 by suicide with a firearm, 505 deaths due to accidental discharge of a firearm, and 281 deaths due to firearms-use with ""undetermined intent"" for a total of 33,169 deaths related to firearms (excluding firearm deaths due to legal intervention). 1.3% of all deaths in the country were related to firearms.

So should we be more worried about nutcase U.S.-born Muslims, or the proliferation of firearms?  Should we go along with the NRA's victories to keep us from being protected from lunatics acquiring guns, domestic violence criminals from getting AK-47s, or children under five picking up guns and killing their siblings or friends?

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

A combination of both aspects might be necessary for a comprehensive code.

2. **Increase specificity**: While Extreme Biblical Laws is concise, it might be too broad. Adding specificity, such as Extreme Biblical Moral Codes or Harsh Biblical Teachings, could enhance the code's relevance to the comment.

3. **Improve conciseness**: Codes like Harsh and Extreme Moral Codes: Questioning Relevance are comprehensive but might be too long. A more concise version, such as Questioning Harsh Biblical Teachings, could be more effective.

4. **Maintain abstractiveness**: Codes like Critique of Biblical Literalism are abstract and encompassing, capturing the broader theme of questioning the Bible's teachings. Refinements should aim to maintain this level of abstractiveness while ensuring the code remains relevant to the comment.

5. **Consider alternative phrases**: Using alternative phrases, such as Challenging Modern Relevance or Skepticism towards Biblical Authority, could provide fresh perspectives and help refine the codes.

Some potential refined codes based on these suggestions include:

* **Extreme Biblical Teachings: Challenging Modern Relevance** (combines the descriptive and evaluative aspects)
* **Questioning Harsh Biblical Morality** (increases specificity and conciseness)

"And the deflection begins again!

Another shooting, this time part of the 3.5% of the population was the target.  So the typical outcry is eliminate guns or eliminate discrimination or more hate crimes laws.  When the real ""cause"" had nothing to do with firearms or discrimination.  The base cause is cultural.  The shooter's culture vs American culture.

Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American.  As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home.  Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act.  ISIS announced an attack 3 days before.  Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic.  These are the storyline so far.

He and his Father were known to the FBI and ""on their radar"" but the FBI couldn't tie them to any terror cell.  Just like the Boston bomber and the San Bernardino shooters.  The FBI was useless or complicit.

"I taught my boys that they have to do the work for themselves AND the girl.  That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings.

"So, by that token you have studied history and are fully aware of the terror, torture, empire building, murders, and subjugation that the christians have wrought on the world as well. Weren't the crusades nothing more than the christians engaging in the same type of activities on muslims for centuries. 

Really seems like about the only good that comes out of religion is a reason to fight someone else because their beliefs are different. And it cuts both ways. My religion is the only one that is valid in my eyes, as yours is the only one that is valid in your eyes, as Islam is the only one that is valid in the muslim's eye. 

Throw into the mix the complete muck-up the US has made of the middle east since the 60's when we armed so many of our now attackers trying to fight the scourge of communism. We can continue to paint this as an issue of a religion that wants to ""destroy christianity"", but that is akin to trying to describe an elephant to a blind man by describing only the trunk.",Religious conflict and justification for violence,Critique of Religious Exclusivity and Historical Hypocrisy,Violence in the Name of Religion: Historical and Contemporary Contexts,"1.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color.
