Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.\nPeople hate, God does not.

And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out. \n\nThe Catholics used to be focused on things like orphanages and priceless artifacts and poisoning each other at the Vatican.  They should stick to that, and stop trying to gin up more false grist for the propaganda machine that is rapidly destroying our democracy and turning the U.S. into ungovernable factions where every problem has to be solved in federal court.

Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.\n\nYet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.\n\nYet another 'Christian' double-standard rears its ugly head.  Halleleujah.",

You are also completely ignorant about where money in Alaska Native Corporations comes from. It does not come from taxpayers, and did not come from taxpayers except when they were originally chartered with funds that compensated for Alaska Native lands that were stolen. Remember they owned all of Alaska before European and American colonization. the Russians sold Alaska to the Americans, but they sold something they never owned.

No, he just prefers to use them for group sex and if you do biz with him, you can be pretty sure he will bring one of his many women around for you to play with while he takes pictures. Hmm, where do those photos go?  Maybe this is one of many reasons his marriage ended so terribly.  Hearing him talk to one of his many nannies who took his daughters to the beach with a bunch of friends and asking repeatedly if they were being touchy feely and flirty is creepy! He kept encouraging the nanny to give them alone time to play. Seriously?!?!  Snitz is single for a reason. If you date him, you date his friends too. The horror stories of multiple women are all so similar. Charming, come out to all these fancy places, come on my plane, oh and on my friends too.  His daughter's aren't as dumb as he'd like and they are well aware of his shenanigans.

That is why we have gravel mined in the valley. The Alaska natives have mineral rights to their land. The Alaska native veterans can still homestead. But not the non-native veteran. It's the old divide and conquer. It is the reduction of our rights and opportunity incrementally and slowly. Can you imagine if Massachusetts had as many parks and national set aside lands as Alaska does? It would not exist. I trust every day people to be good managers of their property, until they prove otherwise. UAA owns land in Alaska and manages it. Why can't Joe Citizen own land with mineral rights? Why can't Joe Citizen still homestead?",

It also highlights the role of land management policies in this process.\n\nIn comparison, LLM-1's code, \"Discriminatory land management and erosion of non-native rights,\" is also a viable option. However, it could be refined to more specifically refer to the speaker's sentiment of eroding individual rights.

Perhaps we could refine the codes to capture this emotional aspect, such as \"Mistrust in Land Management: Erosion of Non-Native Rights\" or \"Disillusionment through Discriminatory Land Policies.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these alternative refinements?

Considering the discussions and suggestions from both LLM-1 and LLM-2, here are a few refinements and observations:\n\n1. **Incorporation of \"Disillusionment\" and \"Erasure\":** The codes have evolved to include the emotional and psychological impacts of the policies, such as \"A Sense of Erasure and Disillusionment.\" This is a valuable addition as it highlights the human aspect of the issue, beyond just the legal or administrative aspects.\n\n2. **Specificity about Affected Groups:** The inclusion of \"Non-Native\" in many of the refined codes emphasizes the specific demographic affected by these policies. This specificity is crucial for understanding the context and the potential discriminatory nature of the policies.\n\n3. **Clarity on Policy Impact:** Phrases like \"Eroding Individual Rights\" and \"Discriminatory Land Management\" clearly convey the negative impact of the policies on individual rights and freedoms. This clarity is essential for effective communication and analysis of the issue.\n\n4. **Consideration of \"Mineral Rights\" and \"Homesteading Opportunities\":** While the current codes focus on the general erosion of individual rights, it might be beneficial to explicitly mention \"mineral rights\" and \"homesteading opportunities\" in some codes to fully encapsulate the speaker's concerns. For example, \"Discriminatory Land Management Eroding Non-Native Individual Rights to Homesteading and Mineral Extraction.\"\n\n5. **Balancing Specificity and Broad Applicability:** While specificity is important, it's also crucial to ensure that the codes can be applied broadly enough to capture similar concerns in other contexts. A code like \"Discriminatory Land Management Eroding Individual Rights\" maintains a balance between specificity and broad applicability, allowing for the analysis of similar issues across different demographics or geographical locations.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following refined codes could be suggested:\n\n- **Discriminatory Land Management Eroding Non-Native Rights to Land and Resources**\n- **Erosion of Individual Rights through Land Policy: A Case of Non-Native Disillusionment**\n- **Land Management Policies and the Erasure of Non-Native Individual Freedoms**\n\nThese codes aim to capture the essence of the speaker's concern with a balance of specificity and broad applicability, while also incorporating the emotional and psychological impacts of discriminatory land management policies.",

    "comment": "If Public Schools are doing their job putting condoms on bananas as early as sixth grade I fail to wonder how aside from a refresher course  in banana prepping is going to make a big difference. No more \"mystery of life\" is going to happen on your honey moon, by the time you are 7th grade you know it all. I fail to surmise how additional funds can can benefit such women who are older, who put condoms on bananas, and still didn't get a clue. Are we all now responsible for the dumb chick who put a condom on the banana but not the phallus?  Are we really all responsible for the mistakes of other people? And why are we?",

Because the secular government will impose legal sanctions on any qutb ('preacher') who exercised his right to practice our faith as written in our Scripture.\n\nAnd there is such a thing as 'freedom of association'.  At least for now.  We don't have to marry you in our Masjid, because by our rules at least one of you has to be Muslim.  For starters.  If the bishop has any sense, he'd take that position as well.

This argument also fails to grasp professional teams are not recruiting professional women, they are recruiting professional men, and therein you have to kick down the bucks to get better players or lose them to professional teams.

My Native/African American kids were kicked out of Wilson but not allowed to take their IEP money with them when they tried to get alternative school help with better teachers. Wilson said- \"you can't be here but you can't have the finds designed to help you either!\" Guess what Native kids in PPS do even worse than they do at NAYA. If you had some form of political analysis on race you might be able to be a part of the solution not the problem. Are you saying Native Americans are the only problem with our school system? Are you claiming Native Americans lie and no other school group does? (PLEASE!) Put on your journalism big girl panties and do some real research and stop bowing down to the racist status quo Portland has had  for over 150 years- it's old.",

    "comment": "Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  \n\nIn this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  \n\nIt's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.   Many aren't able to accept that basic change in attitude.",

    "comment": "As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.\nLike so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex. That would solve a lot of problems and wouldn't cost that much.",

The people of Portland need to ask themselves why Nigel Jaquiss is so incredibly secretive about his own life. To me personally, having heard things about him, I know there is something extremely sinister behind his facade of blond, white normalcy. His obsession with the sex lives of powerful white men for one, and his sick need to take good people down, using tabloid headlines like this one...Good old Nigel reminds me of J. Edgar Hoover. He keeps files on people and every day he's sniffing out dirt and smut, so he can make even more enemies in Portland. I even heard he had a file on me. Say it isn't so Nigel. :)",

Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.\n\nHow is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print\n\nThe Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.\n\nI was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.",

The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old \"fuck you, it's Friday\" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.  Eddie Vedder joined them onstage and they looked like teenagers up there just enjoying being a part of our night.  Bruce is a throwback who still has a lot to offer those willing to truly listen.",

A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.\n\nThe fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.\n\nWhat a ridiculous campaign.",

Terms like \"inadequate,\" \"misinformed,\" and \"misaligned\" have been used to describe Drake's civic understanding and campaign priorities. Choosing the most fitting term from these suggestions could enhance the code's clarity.\n\n3. **Emphasis on Consequences**: While the codes have effectively highlighted Drake's shortcomings and the misdirection of his campaign, considering the potential consequences of these issues could add depth to the code.

There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

Fool me once, shame on you but fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nThis guy is obviously an abuser.  Call it borderline mentally ill if you want but the fact will remain.  This guy murdered a woman who was supposed to be his girlfriend.  Being drunk or on drugs is a pretty lame excuse for murder.  \n\nRehab, in prison?  Good luck with that.  How many repeat offenders are there who 'successfully' completed rehab?  Got paroled on good behavior?\n\nYes, there is always a chance but there should be a 2 strike rule for those who murder.  You get one chance and if you screw up, it is a done deal!  Sure save a lot of State money too.",

Those who earn superdelgate status have been going to meetings weekly and monthly for years, not just in the election season and election year.  Concerned, involved citizens deserve this position, and they are there to do what's best for the party and avoid demagogues. Sanders is a recent convert as a Democrat, he's not giving the party any money (unlike Clinton) and should be focusing his supporters' attention on taking back the Senate rather than bashing fellow Democrats.

Please leave Alinsky, Rules for radicals scripture out of your answer.. hahaha.. Sandya, shame on you thinking its ok to call Christians, \"The Religious Right\".  shame on you.

So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news.

A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. \nI referenced a popular \"clobber\" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. \nThen there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. \nThe suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. \nThen there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.\nJesus didn't say a word about homosexuality.

This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?\n     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?

However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. \n\nB) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved. \n\nYou think that pointing out that white people have enjoyed a long period of benefit from subjugating other races and nationalities is racist?

I want a cake for my 4o the wedding anniversary and I go to the bakery and only based on \"profiling\" me since I  \"could\" be \"gay\" they can refuse to bake me a cake . If one goes into a business and does no know it does for religious reasons not serve \"gays\" is there to be a test to see if a customer is \"gay\" or not? So if a person does not look or act gay they will get a cake baked and if the gay person who does not look or act gay ( according to the usual  stereotype) does that gay person be charged with a crime of attempting to \"defraud\" a business since they did not tell the owners that they were gay?

Her \"extensive\" international experience includes siding with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (One vote, one time), removing Ghaddafi (We came, we saw, he died) with no plan afterwards, turning oil-rich Libya into a hell-hole with thousands fleeing to Europe causing the refugee crisis. Her failure to urge Obama to maintain troops in Iraq allowed ISIS to gain a foothold in the region. Mrs. Clinton also botched her \"re-start\" with Russia, handing the foreign minister a mistranslated \"restart\" button. Russia has resumed its aggressive posture (Ukraine, Crimea), knowing it was amateur hour at the US State Department. And her lies about Benghazi are a disgrace; she was AWOL during the 3 am phone call. Mrs. Clinton is guilty of felonies for storing classified information on a non-secure, non-government server.

This is part of a family with multiple convictions over the generations. However, the impounded vehicle (with the stolen goods inside) was released from impound to someone using a false address. The owner will never see his stuff again. The break-in artists are free to steal again. Now we neighbors are concerned that the brave person who followed and reported these professional thieves will be subject to retaliation. This is just a microcosm of the Mat-Su and Alaska justice system...mirrors the murder situation in this article. The reasons for not fully prosecuting miscreants is: Lenient (\"too compassionate\") District Attorneys; easy judges; and, the kicker: not enough room in our prisons. Violent offenders like Mr. Almeda are barely punished, allowing them to seduce and kill vulnerable young women.",

As far as your god hypothesis goes there is as much evidence to support your belief in a supernatural being as there is santa clause the tooth fairy and the flying spaghetti monster.

This integration captures the essence of the comment, which involves the relationship between protest behavior, free speech rights, and the consequences of intolerance.\n\n2. **Clarity and specificity**: The refined code is more detailed and specific than the initial codes. However, for the sake of brevity and ease of understanding, we might consider distilling it further while retaining its core elements. For instance, \"Nonviolent Protest vs. Free Speech: The Role of Intolerance in Shaping Public Perception\" could be a more concise version that still conveys the main themes.\n\n3. **Balance between detail and generality**: The code should be detailed enough to capture the nuances of the comment but general enough to be applicable to a variety of situations where similar themes are discussed. The current refined code strikes a good balance, emphasizing the core concepts of nonviolent protest, free speech, and the impact of intolerance.\n\n4. **Future applicability**: Consider whether the refined code could be applied to analyze comments or discussions beyond the current context. A code that is too specific to the current situation might not be as useful for future analyses. The proposed integrated code has a good level of generality that could make it applicable to other discussions involving protests, free speech, and public perception.\n\n5. **Precision in terminology**: Ensure that the terms used in the code are precisely defined and understood. For example, \"nonviolent civil disobedience\" and \"constitutional free speech rights\" are specific legal and social concepts. Clarifying these terms within the context of the code could enhance its clarity and usefulness.\n\nBased on these considerations, a potential refinement could be:\n\n**\"Protest and Free Speech: The Intolerance Paradox\"**\n\nThis version aims to maintain the core concepts while making the code more concise and memorable. It highlights the central themes of protest, free speech, and the paradoxical effects of intolerance on public perception, without losing the essence of the integrated code proposed by LLM-1.",

Only in an idiotic society like America would such ideas as \"only nice girls get pregnant, others use birth control\" prevail. If one is sexually active one needs to find as reliable a method of birth control as possible in order to reduce recourse to abortion which is inconvenient. In most other countries that can be compared with the US, such ideas as those expressed by Dejain would be considered a sign of a intellectual deficiency or lack of education. Religious sentiment still runs deep here in backwards America.",

Turns out, pubic hair has literally nothing to do with love.\"\n\nI often rock a full bush (TMI?) and many of our clients see us for all kinds of stuff (facials & relaxation included). And since I'm the one who spends a good deal of my time sugaring vaginas, I'd like to mention that the majority of my clients say that THEY like it and THEY feel good (regardless of what a partner thinks). And yes - many say that it helps with orgasming (not sure why but I'll take their word for it!)\n\nAnd just to be clear (since your Twitter follower wasn't), we don't imply that one must get vagina hair removed to be a \"portland girl\".",

        "Here is the final agreed qualitative code:\n\nCode Name: Christianist Voting Behavior - Perceived Divine Disobedience, Politicization of Faith, and Religious Rhetoric Skepticism\n\nCode Description: This code captures the skepticism towards the use of religious rhetoric in politics, specifically questioning the legitimacy of political decisions influenced by divine guidance. It focuses on Christianist voting behavior and the perceived inconsistency in this behavior due to the perceived disobedience of divine guidance. Additionally, this code addresses the confusion, critique, and dilemmas surrounding the politicization of faith and spirituality. Finally, it includes skepticism and critique of religious rhetoric used in political campaigns and its broader implications.",
        "Based on the discussion, the final agreed qualitative code is:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Christianist Voting due to Perceived Divine Disobedience**: This code captures the skepticism towards Ted Cruz's decision to quit due to divine guidance and the perceived inconsistency in Christianist voting behavior.\n2. **Questioning Divine Influence in Political Decisions**: This code reflects the confusion and critique regarding the use of divine guidance in political decisions and the politicization of faith.\n3. **Politicization of Faith and its Dilemmas**: This code synthesizes the themes of politicization of faith, its consequences, and the complexities of Christianist voting behavior.\n4. **Skepticism towards Religious Rhetoric in Politics**: This code captures the skepticism and critique towards the use of religious rhetoric in politics and the potential consequences of politicized spirituality.\n5. **Critique of Politicized Spirituality and its Consequences**: This code expands on the critique of politicized spirituality, highlighting the potential consequences and implications of using faith and divine guidance in political campaigns.\n\nThese five codes provide a comprehensive and refined framework for analyzing the themes and emotions expressed in the comment, capturing the complexities of the relationship between faith, divine guidance, and Christianist voting behavior."
