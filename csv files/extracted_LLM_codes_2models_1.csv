"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"Well, this wasn't meant to be a dissertation. It's an entertainment piece, so I was mostly trying to be funny—whether I was successful in that regard is up to the reader.

"All this ""support our"" troops"" stuff is a bunch of drivel.  Why people would respect anyone who is willing to kill someone because they were ordered to by another, is beyond my comprehension.

A bunch of others will head for the hills with their backpacks in hand and still others will simply head for jail. It could be the beginning of something positive, drafting women.

"I see it. The black people riot, set buildings on fire, loot businesses, attack innocent people and attack the police and the FBI did nothing . what the black people did last year was a act of terrorism by placing innocent people's lives  in danger . these white men did not riot, did not burn down buildings, did not attack innocent people, did not attacks cops and did not place innocent peoole's life in danger but the FBI went after them as if they were terrorist. There is a big difference in between in how we act compared to the black lives matter people.",Differential Response to Black vs. White Civil Unrest,Double Standard/Racial Bias,"**Differential Response to Black vs. White Civil Unrest (Double Standard/Racial Bias)**

This code captures the perceived discrepancy in the response to civil unrest involving Black and White individuals, with harsher measures being taken against White groups despite their actions being characterized as less violent. The code also emphasizes the different behaviors exhibited by Black and White groups during civil unrest, and suggests that this discrepancy is due to a double standard or racial bias in the treatment of different racial groups by law enforcement. This code conveys the specific issue of differential treatment while also acknowledging the broader context of racial bias.","**Systemic Racial Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Civil Unrest**

This code captures the perceived discrepancy in law enforcement's response to civil unrest, highlighting the differential treatment of Black individuals and White groups, with a focus on the historical and systemic power imbalance, and the potential for racial bias in favor of or against a particular group.

**Differential Law Enforcement Response to Racialized Civil Unrest (Systemic Racial Bias)**

This will help to ensure that the code accurately captures the perceived issue.

2. **Incorporate the concept of systemic racism**: Consider adding language that acknowledges the role of systemic racism in perpetuating unequal treatment. This could include phrases such as institutional racism or structural racism to emphasize the idea that the bias is embedded in the system.

3. **Emphasize the power dynamic**: Highlight the power imbalance between law enforcement and marginalized communities, which can contribute to the perceived bias.

4. **Consider adding a subset of codes**: Break down the main code into smaller, more specific subcodes that capture different aspects of the issue, such as:
   * Disproportionate response to Black civil unrest
   * Leniency towards White civil unrest
   * Racial bias in policing practices
   * Systemic racism in law enforcement institutions

5. **Use more descriptive language**: Instead of using general terms like differential response, consider using more descriptive language that captures the essence of the issue, such as disproportionate force, unequal treatment, or racialized policing.

6. **Incorporate the concept of intersectionality**: Consider adding language that acknowledges the intersection of multiple forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and classism, which can contribute to the perceived bias.",Collaborative Refinement: Perceived Discrepancy in Law Enforcement Response to Civil Unrest (Directional Double Standard/Systemic Racial Bias and Power Dynamics).,"Systemic Racial Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Civil Unrest (Directional Double Standard, Intersectional Discrimination, and Emotional Impact)","Systemic Racial Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Civil Unrest (Directional Double Standard, Intersectional Discrimination, Power Dynamics, and Emotional Impact)","Systemic Racial Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Civil Unrest (Directional Double Standard, Intersectional Discrimination, and Emotional Impact)"
"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

But yeah, I share your feelings that a racist religious terrorist like Ammon Bundy seems to get off easy.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both. 

Now, Mr. Weinerman invokes the current chaos neighboring countries; chaos caused entirely by the American intervention in Iraq in 2003, as reason enough to hold on to what they took nearly 50 years ago.",Israeli land expansion & impact on democracy & peace,Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Injustice and Occupation,"1.

"Since the Republicans have vowed to deny any nominee a vote, Obama should make a recess appointment.  Currently Congress is in recess and he could do it now.

He was a champion of bigotry, blocking progress for non-heterosexuals at every turn.  He also blocked environmental protection every chance he got.  He had nine children, which is selfish and irresponsible......he was probably opposed to birth control.  And one of his favorite activities was killing defenseless animals for fun.

Wow.  Thanks for this.  I love the disconnect between Bailey attending a somewhat scary church (female submission, anti-gay) and being a progressive.  It shows something hard to define, but not very likable, about his character.  He's kinda wishy-washy.

"Finally someone is speaking up against the rich and powerful Ainsworth Spanish Immersion (ASI) syndicate.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far. The ASI Spanish speakers are mostly rich white Hispanic families, who are now claiming to be part of the historically underserved population. This is an abomination. ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

"You provide an unspecific example of some organization that supposedly doesn't accept a white member but of course you make no mention of the major American institutions that have failed to integrate (continue to practice discrimination) due to the fact that they are dominated by white people and promote their material interests: the American system of education, political institutions, residential areas (and don't claim that Blacks or Latinos desire to live in racially segregated neighborhoods because peer-reviewed research contradicts that claim), employment. 
From the beginning and continuing today, is the dominant white culture that has instituted the division of society based on race.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. (You are rationalizing warnings about anti-gay and female submission) and Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid (that is pretty much your modus operandi).",Confirmation Bias in Attribution of Groupthink,**GROUPTHINK_DENIAL**,Confirmation Bias in Attribution of Groupthink and GROUPTHINK_DENIAL are the qualitative codes extracted from the response.,"1. **CONFIRMATION_BIAS_MISATTRIBUTION_AS_GROUPTHINK_DENIAL**

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

I won't vote any member of Imago Dei.  Do you really think Pastor McKinley is going to change his conservative Baptist ways and reject female submission and embrace equality of gays and heteros?

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike)
and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.  I think the world would be a better place if Imago Dei shrinks because their doctrine is unacceptable.

"My point was that as much as you dismiss Springsteen, or think that you should be able to give him input on his songwriting to have his songs better represent fast food workers, a tiny drop of piss dribbled out of him this morning that's more credible than you in the music industry. He was considered a talented up and coming artist in the early 1970's, he's made top ten records that covered un-coverable independent bands, he wrote for Patti Smith when you were in diapers. 

Have some goddamn respect. 

The reason you look like such a childish person right now is that you are trying to hand-wave away Springsteen's 40 year career as a well-respected, credible, honest, and down to Earth musician, and the only reasons you've given amount to ""he's white, he's got a bunch of money, he doesn't write song about Subway, and he wears jeans"".

Or how about this--since British colonialism in India seems to have struck a chord, is there any chance these folks are storing away some energy for protesting India's home-grown caste system--which still exists, by the way?  Say, here's a thought: I'm sure there's at least one Indian restaurant in Portland.  How about picketing them for the caste system?  Oh, wait--they may not be white.

This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot.

UAA hasn't done comparative study of white vs Native sentencing since 1973 (most recent one I've been able to find so far).  Wonder why?  I suspect because there's a lot MORE 'history' to this that's by no means 'ancient', and a lot of guilty white cops, judges and DAs would prefer it doesn't get spot-lighted.  IIRC a very popular Galilean carpenter once said 'evil-doers hateth the light.  And my exegesis is: 'especially thin-skinned white ones.'",The qualitative code extracted from the response is: White bias in justice system evidence suppression.,Systemic Racism Denial and Institutional Cover-Up,"Suppression of Evidence for Systemic Justice Bias

"Fredrick, I'm sure that by now you and I are the only ones following this comment thread. I rate all comments as ""sorta ok"" and ""civil"" also.

Anyway, I mustn't have made my point clear. I don't mean to hint that there is a pro Muslim bias. I'm implying that there is a anti Christian bias. It's no secret that Christianity is fair game, the media and contemporary culture carefully walks on egg shells whenever dealing with issues involving other religions. Don't worry, as soon as the more ignorant members (media/Hollywood/academia) of our society realize that Islam is also monotheistic and is as intolerant (theologically speaking) as is Christianity, they will then attack Islam and Muslims also.",Perceived anti-Christian bias and anticipated Islam criticism,Perceived Double Standard,Refined Code: Perceived Double Standard and Anticipated Bias Equalization,"- Perceived Double Standard, with Anticipated Convergence through Increased Understanding

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

"Bob Lacher - Actually, I wouldn't have a problem with some parents or teachers being concealed carry. I'm not worried about IS. I'm worried about the insane guy who decides kids in swimming suits are beaming thoughts into his brain and decides to open up on them. Or the lone-wolf Islamic terrorists who decide that swim suits are too revealing and decide to do the same. I would rather have parents who are concealed carry in the stands than armed guards with automatic weapons at the ready at the door.
