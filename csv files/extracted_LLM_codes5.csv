"Everyone is aware Trump has the right to say things such as of a female journalist, ""there was blood coming out of her wherever"" or his reference to Clinton's visit to the restroom during the debates as ""too disgusting"" or when he said about Latinos ""they're rapists,"" they are simply questioning his judgement and fitness for the highest office in the nation due to his willingness to defame and denigrate entire groups of his fellow citizens based on their ethnicity, religion or sex for the purpose of gaining votes. 
There are de jure and de facto limits to free speech: you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater without risking arrest and you can't call someone ""nigg*r"" or ""c*unt"" without risking injury in many cases. Trump won't be arrested of course, he'll just be put out to some pasture where hideous, old, shriveled, small-handed tycoons belong. He's promised not to show his face again after losing.

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community? 

 If religious bias leads to charity, empathy, compassion, I'm OK.  If religious bias is toward killing non believers, I have a problem

Maybe the best we can do is recognize our bias consciously and deal with it.",Awareness and Management of Inevitable Bias in a Diverse Society.,Confronting Implicit Bias,Inherent Bias and its Dual Nature: Acknowledgment and Management,Acknowledging and Managing Perpetual Bias,"- Awareness and Management of Inevitable Bias in a Diverse Society

"This is literally one of the most offensive pieces of writing I've seen in a really long time.

"“You don’t need no gun control, you know what you need? We need some bullet control. Men, we need to control the bullets, that’s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms. What does it say about a civilized society that we would have to bleep a statement from the leading Republican candidate because he was being ""truthful""?
For example, ""shit"" ""ass"" ""schlonged"" ""fuck"" ""bullshit"" ""fat ass"" ""bastard"" ""crap"" and ""motherfuckers"". 
People might say ""he won't do this as President"". He is just getting free media attention"" or ""he doesn't mean it"".  But all I have to go on is how people act. That's the best resume for president.

"I love the FBI. I have many old time agent friends. But let me recall. The FBI investigated the shooter twice, and found nothing to charge. The FBI runs the firearm background checks. They approved  the shooters purchase. One gun shop refused to a sell high grade vest and large amount of ammunition but failed to get his name and vehicle ID. Now Loretta Lynch claims she does not know where the wife who helped the shooter is, so does that also include the FBI?""

And we have a white house that orders all reference to Jihad, Islam, Muslim  terrorist removed from all Federal officer manuals (including the FBI) and Loretta threatened to charge anyone in law enforcement who used disparaging language like ""terrorist"" Islamic Terrorist"" Muslim and such until some news person reminded this AG about the first amendment.

"Just another sexual assault.  Oh, it must have been the alcohol.  Ban alcohol.  
Another shooting, by a muslim declaring terrorist associations.  Blame the gun.
Another theft, burglary, robbery, murder, etc.  Blame drugs, blame society, blame anything except the person who commits the crime!  

Many of these crimes are by repeat offenders or those on a 'watchlist' of known gang members, drug dealers.  Just what good is a watchlist anyway?  Does it really help the investigation after the crime is committed?  Are all of those who law enforcement have been watching pulled in for questioning?

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel.

"I love how white folks talk about how ""color"" is not a factor within the PPS system (you should surely know what it's like to experience systemic racism) and how the ""guise"" of political correctness is often confused with giving marginalized communities respect and recognizing the horrible history of inequity and oppression they've had to endure.

Why are you appalled when a disenfranchised community decides to take a larger role in the education of their children in order to address disparities and inequities?

"Reading all these comments on assless chaps made me laugh. Seriously tho I'm a Christian, I wouldn't take my kids to the parade and I wouldn't be standing out there screaming hateful, hurtful words to anyone who did go. It upsets me when I hear about Christians making bad choices like that, it doesn't really represent the Christian community well, it's not kid friendly, and you can't share the love of our Lord and Savior Jesus by screaming hate and hell speech ugh! And I wouldn't want my kids seeing some dude running around in chaps and a thong. Butts, boobs and whatever else should be for adults not kids.  I wouldn't let my kids look at anyone running around showing their ass lol  Anyway everyone is allowed to make their own choices, some choose to be hateful, some choose to be almost naked, some choose to show their kids adult situations.

"Thank you Elizabeth for your well written letter.  I blame our regulators.  The AMA approved the sale.  Shame on them.  Shame on Trillium.  Unfortunately, no amount of disgust, sorrow and frustration will change anything.  I posted yesterday my doctors name and her husband.  They've got their million.  I love my doctor and I'm sorry I failed in my now deleted post to express that.  I'd been w/Dr Mary Pugsley for many years and she always, always made me feel like she really cared.  She listened.  She ordered tests when I needed them.  Never hesitated.

It still stands true however, that beginning 3 years ago, she changed.  The 'fake' physicals where we just chatted.  The concern I had over some new strange symptoms that scared me.  She said ""huh, that's not normal"" and then sent me on my way w/no information.  She'd changed.

"What lies did Clinton tell about the attack?  Are you referring to the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" being blamed?

That embassies in Yemen, Pakistan, Egypt and Tunisia were also attacked in response to the film?  The main difference between Benghazi and the other attacks is that the other attacks were all on hardened, purpose built facilities, while the Benghazi attack was on a non-hardened, leased, temporary facility.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

"No, not everyone is Portland is racist, but Portland has a long history of racist actions, including wiping out entire black neighborhoods for coliseums and hospitals, and then bitching when a home on a single lot is turned into multiple dwellings.

So, essentially, you despise mainstream black culture because of ""macho posturing, opportunism and predation, and violence including its lesser forms (e.g. coercion, peer pressure etc.)"" and assume that every black person is automatically that way?

Would it be fair to say you hate black culture (because of someone else bullying you) even though you've never personally been affected by it?

If he is going to make all these cuts , why on earth isn't the biggest current drain on the state budget stopped or frozen as well  ?  Walker claims the state can't survive without our PFD yet months ago he wrote a check to Canada for 65 million . Now he wants to put us on the hook for billions for this gas line pie in the sky that doesn't pencil out.      The fact of the matter is all the polling showed Walker would lose again in the primary to Parnell---that's why he turned independent. The polling showed the democrats had zero chance of winning---that's why they quit .   Simply put---Alaskan's didn't want Walker .  They just didn't want Parnell after the media's constant attacks on him.  We got a poor quality governor and that explains why he's doing a pathetic job now. He needs to be recalled. Now !","```

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.

"This honestly astounds me.

The case presented, point by point, would, and should have lead unto an indictment, but yet did not, within the end.

The most duplicitous individual to have run for office within recent history is allowed to continue to do so, no matter that our own FBI has identified lie after lie after lie, publicly stated, within that no reasonable thinking prosecutor would pursue said case?

Really?

How do supporters of this individual sleep at night?

Guess what supporters, you are next to feel the wrath of the Clinton machine.

You may not see it now, but you will feel it in the very near future, should this evil entity actually attain the White-House, as this individual does not give a damn about you, your own family, your neighbourhood, your community, your city, or your Nation.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

The best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.",Hypocritical business practices: Hobby Lobby operates online on Sundays despite claiming to honor the Sabbath by keeping physical stores closed.,Hypocrisy,Hypocrisy in Business Practices,"1.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it. But as I noted above, Financial Facts I pulled up just using the back of an envelope and 30 minutes show 1 Billion + in savings can be had without touching the PFD, without any new taxes, and without even touching SB21 or the Oil tax Credits. I could do a lot better with a copy of the actual budget in hand. How is it a lower-class, uneducated mutt like myself can find over a billion in savings when our high-class, 70k + per year salaried Oilies in the Legislature can only find the Permanent Fund to Raid?

If the Legislature REALLY wants the people behind it, they need to process all the savings I noted, restructure SB21, and *eliminate*, not DEFER, most of the Tax Credits.

"I would like to hear from anyone who is being inconvenienced by not having a $27 million dollar city hall? And a $185 million 7 story court house for fools,criminals and fat assed trial lawyers. I guess if the public employees unions and bureaucrats/politicians are able to lie and sneak their sales tax through  we might need the extra space for the unemployed and middle class families resorting to crime to feed themselves. But alas with so few law enforcement officers out and about whose gonna arrest all those new criminals?
A recall sounds better and better. In case you are interested that is around $622 for every man,women and child in the county just to enhance the criminals experience through our wonderful justice system and fancy office space.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else? 

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

"Bogus statistic, More white men are shot and killed by police than are black men in the country. Facts are such a pesky thing. Of course, if you are talking about all categories of shootings and talking about Chicago, then I stand corrected. BLM say that they are non violent and just want to have an honest dialogue and get the problems out in the open so that they can be solved. Then how about addressing the dishonest statistics they cite, how about addressing the way that young blacks respond to any question by a police officer or request by an officer? I was raised on the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Or put another way, approach determines response. In other words, how you approach someone determines the response you will get.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"""Of course all lives should matter and the point made by BLM is that they should matter too, not more"".   Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM. What red, yellow, white and brown skinned people hear clearly...is that Black Lives Matter more and are therefore more valued. So how do you explain BLM to the Korean Americans angered by police killing of a young male.  La Habra police were too quick to shoot in New Year's Eve incident, critics say. A young man killed for alledged vandalism with a tire iron but no weapon. A young man of YELLOW skinned pigmentation. Isn't it less damning to say ALL Lives matter and not single out  Blacks. Imagine if you will, what the parents of this deceased young man are feeling every time they see and hear BLM..., he was not black but didn't his life matter?

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
He later recounted ""I was relieved to see a white man.""
