"amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject  covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe.",Dismissal of mother's advocacy due to tobacco industry misconceptions,Defensive Tribute,"**Proud Defense Against Misconceptions**

This code captures the essence of the comment, which is a proud and defensive response to criticism of the author's mother's accomplishments, particularly in the context of her work on safety laws and her advice to asthma patients to smoke one cigarette a day as a form of relief. The code conveys the author's emotional tone, which is protective and proud of their mother's legacy, while also being dismissive and critical of those who belittle her achievements due to misunderstandings about her role in the tobacco industry. The refined code also emphasizes the historical context of doctors prescribing cigarettes for asthma patients and the author's emphasis on moderation, not excessive smoking.","**Proud Defense of Mother's Legacy**

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]  

Frankly, I'm at a complete loss as to why you are so determined to contradict our historians,  the NAACP at  the Mims etc. on this.

To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman. I would like to hear from girls dressing as boys and see if they feel equal amongst the boys.

"""a surge that coincided with the election of the first black U.S. president""

Unless the author is accusing these people of racist behavior, why is this statement in the article? The author could have easily used Barack Obama's name instead of his preferred racial identity.

""...Jerad and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian and also died in a Las Vegas shooting rampage.""

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

It appears these people are sensible, support the Constitution and family values, and have the widely held sense to distrust the government as did our founders.

"DC,

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!  No tar and feathering, no running out on a rail, no lynchings (though I think I do vaguely remember reading about the possibility of a mock lynching).

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

"Oh Mark. To explain anything to you would be like knocking on a dead man’s door and be just as fruitless.

In the words of David Bowie...But I’ll try. I’ll try.

My critical comments spoke to your professional incompetence as a publisher, and was not personal. We’ve never met, have we? However, judging from your initial personal attack on me and your subsequent two-dimensional responses, my criticisms proved to have merit.

I could go on and explain that too but …you know, fruitless. You and the Juneau Empire publisher should get together ‘cause you’re like two peas in quite a limited pod. Same lack of comprehension beyond anything complex.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

"Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…). 
With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.
You may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls. Aren't you outraged?

"Transgender is such a small segment of the population but somehow has commanded and demanded that the majority bow to their demands.

You were born with certain parts. That's just how it is. If you want to get a sex change operation, then fine. Once changed, you are then that other sex and you should then use that restroom because you then have those parts. That's why men's restrooms have urinals, and women's don't. It's about the parts.

"Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.

In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.
Don't think O'Connor doesn't assume (just like you) the wise old man and wise old woman are white.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge. Sadly, looking at the statistics for our legal system's incarceration and execution of black males relative to their rates of committing crimes, a whole lot of our judges don't belong on the bench.","```python

Additionally, (and in a serious vein)  I worked with developmentally delayed students and find jokes about ""idiots"", ""retards"" etc insulting to them. 

 It's a struggle going through life so damn PC.  Moreover, at the same time, I've always been a fan of the ""under-dog"", a Red Sox fan, and voted for McGovern.  I think those things go together.  I also ""take-in"" stay dogs and give money to panhandlers.

"No one or  group of people deserved to be targeted and  called names ( pig, rapists, criminals) or insulted ( ""Lying"" Ted, ""Crooked Hillary"", ""Little Marco"" or John McCain is not a real war hero) .  Trump uses insults freely such as ""unattractive, dumb, I am smarter, lightweight, boring, clowns, he's a zero, no talent, a waste."" In fact there are hundreds of people he has done this over his decades in the public eye.   There is no way that Trump would expect for people to not be ""offended"" by his speech because that is why he does it. But as this reporter and Trump will cry ""Free Speech"", it has been ruled on by the courts of this nation that such ""Free Speech"" comes with responsibility. An example of this is that one cannot yell ""fire"" in a crowded theatre.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case.

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)???

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

"Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"".  So the most intolerant and easily influenced followers of Islam feel that they have a duty to make that happen.  And the others ... are not sure.  
Of course the Bible has a similar verse, but the New Testament then has a better message to love your neighbor and to love God.  And that helps considerably, for most people.

"And the deflection begins again!

Another shooting, this time part of the 3.5% of the population was the target.  So the typical outcry is eliminate guns or eliminate discrimination or more hate crimes laws.  When the real ""cause"" had nothing to do with firearms or discrimination.  The base cause is cultural.  The shooter's culture vs American culture.

Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American.  As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home.  Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act.  ISIS announced an attack 3 days before.  Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic.  These are the storyline so far.

He and his Father were known to the FBI and ""on their radar"" but the FBI couldn't tie them to any terror cell.  Just like the Boston bomber and the San Bernardino shooters.  The FBI was useless or complicit.

"I taught my boys that they have to do the work for themselves AND the girl.  That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.  He would be on the hook for child support if a child were produced and he would be the one responsible if she later cried rape.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.

This code acknowledges the perceived threats and radicalism in Islamic teachings as a primary motivator for Islamophobia. It also incorporates the idea that some individuals view their skepticism and fear towards Islam as a rational response to these perceived threats. Additionally, it suggests that the concept of self-defense plays a role in justifying and reinforcing Islamophobic attitudes.

The refined code maintains the core aspects of both initial codes, but emphasizes the complexity of the issue by presenting it as a dynamic interaction between perceived threats and the self-perceived rationalization of fear and mistrust.","Islamophobia driven by Perceived Religious and Cultural Threats, Reinforced by Skepticism and Self-Defense Rationalizations","Both codes proposed by LLM-1 and LLM-2 capture the essence of the initial comment and acknowledge the role of perceived threats, radicalism, and self-defense rationalizations in shaping Islamophobia.

* Incorporate the term radicalism to highlight the specific aspects of Islamic teachings that are being referred to.
* Add rationalizations to emphasize the way in which the perceived threats, radicalism, and self-defense motivations are used as justifications for Islamophobia.

* Be more specific by including religious, cultural, and security threats.
* Add reinforced to capture the ongoing and cyclical nature of the factors that contribute to Islamophobia.

"Mahalo, Todd, for again sharing the best of yourself. Your pain is our pain, and together we can indeed make good from this. The first step, I must note even as we mourn, is to acknowledge that your subhead, ""The Enemy Isn't Religion, It's Homophobia,"" is off target, pun intended. The enemy is a vast group of Americans who support the sale of guns to crazy people. Without guns, the murderers in Newtown, Aurora, Charleston and now Orlando would have done ... what? Thrown rocks? Thrusted knives? Made bombs? I doubt it. They would have done nothing but stew in their own vile bile.

"Another reader, I worked 17 years at DOC Alaska mental health ward so yeah...I have talked with just about every form of mental illness out there. How about you? What we need is a plan of action to deal with the mentally ill because the current approach is simply not working.  You seem to think that all we need to do is give them medication, home and a job. That is naïve at best, stupid at worst.  Mental health is a life time illness so we need a long term plan. And yes, hospitalization must be part of the plan. I dare any mental health clinian out there who claims that he can come up with a medication in a 15 minutes session. It usually requires weeks to come up with what works for just one patient. Helping a human being like this requires a full court press.....not the care bear approach that you like,. Anything else, is a waste of money and that is the hard cold truth.  Another Reader.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again. And they will.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"I think you should mind your own business.  I'm sick of men telling women how they should behave in your eyes.  I think of the movie INDEPENDENCE DAY w/Will Smith.  The First Lady is lady injured and is being cared for from Will's love.  The FL asks ""what do you do for a living'?  ""I'm a dancer"".  FL:  Oh?  A Ballerina?  No, A stripper.  FL is a little ashamed and the young woman says ""Why?  I earn honest money and I take good care of my son"".  

My first wish would be that there were still a lot of manufacturing jobs here that paid well and you could send your kids to college but there aren't.  I think you're stuck on a nasty mindset  and, well, bottom line; it just isn't any of your business.  Don't go to them if they're offensive to you.  L2g

I still have a bit of survivors guilt about that night, all these years later) I got robbed in Eugene once, so does that make me ok now?

"Bill Clinton's economic conservatism did not occur in a vacuum. You will recall Newt Gingrich's ""Contract with America"" and the fact that Republicans obtained a majority in Congress in 1994. Obama is also an economically conservative Democrat and also faced a Republican majority in the House. Progress will be made when the Republican party is fully repudiated and the Democrats take over the political center. The Republican party is showing its true colors in Donald Trump. With the Republicans, you've got a range from ""weapons of mass destruction"" Dick Chaney to ""deport all the Mexicans and Muslims"" Donald Trump and their followers range from misogynist Christians to knuckle dragging white supremacists.

"And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color. Using a majority white, relatively crime free population stat to silence the experiences of brown people is a pretty standard way of keeping people of color on the fringes of the reality you and Tyler Hurst live.
