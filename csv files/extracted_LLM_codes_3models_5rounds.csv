"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"All this ""support our"" troops"" stuff is a bunch of drivel.  Why people would respect anyone who is willing to kill someone because they were ordered to by another, is beyond my comprehension. People who volunteer to participate in American gangsterism obviously do so for personal material gain--and they likely wrap their self-interest in the mantle of patriotism or some other nonsense.

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

But yeah, I share your feelings that a racist religious terrorist like Ammon Bundy seems to get off easy. Lets hope he does a lot of time.","```

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both. 

Now, Mr. Weinerman invokes the current chaos neighboring countries; chaos caused entirely by the American intervention in Iraq in 2003, as reason enough to hold on to what they took nearly 50 years ago.",Israeli land expansion and treatment of Arabs hinders Israeli democracy and peace,Occupation Legitimacy Challenged,"**Code:** Territorial Disputes, Internal Divisions, and External Influences in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict","Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Territorial Disputes, Identity Tensions, and External Factors","- Israeli land expansion and treatment of Arabs hinders Israeli democracy and peace

"You are stating the same sort of conspiracy theory that supporters of the occupiers have been making online in countless discussion forums.   These are extremist anti-government hate groups, and are no different than Islamic terrorists with regarding to the irrationality of their thinking.   Back on Feb 2nd, it was announced that the investigation into Finicum's shooting would not be done until early to mid March.   The investigation is being headed by the Deschutes County Sheriff's office, with assistance from the Bend and Redmond police departments.

Yet, you attempt to make some sort of anti-government conspiracy out of this investigation, when it is being handled normally according to established protocols.   You need to spend more time reading real news, and stop listening to all of the nonsense on these anti-government websites.

Wow.  Thanks for this.  I love the disconnect between Bailey attending a somewhat scary church (female submission, anti-gay) and being a progressive.  It shows something hard to define, but not very likable, about his character.  He's kinda wishy-washy.   

I, for one, don't want a candidate who acts on woo-woo beliefs
and goes to a church that disdains the lifestyles of many Portlanders.

Gay people, co-habitors, feminists should consider whether they want Bailey to lead the city, given his almost schizoid spirituality (my church is great even if the doctrines and clergy are backwards and bigoted).

"Finally someone is speaking up against the rich and powerful Ainsworth Spanish Immersion (ASI) syndicate.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far. The ASI Spanish speakers are mostly rich white Hispanic families, who are now claiming to be part of the historically underserved population. This is an abomination. ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

That is the real injustice here.

"I agree. The super rich will not give up their power willingly and will use violence, CIA dirty tricks, the FBI and whatever other means necessary to prevent the impoverished and exploited masses from taking back the power that rightfully belongs to them. 
Some of these people will use legal means for the take back of power, while others will necessarily fight violence with violence. It will take both approaches to obtain results.
The Malheur occupation was a situation of rich ranchers exploiting the ignorance of poorer white people to legitimate the privatization of public lands, one of the aims of the super rich. The Malheur occupation didn't succeed. Poor white people have the disadvantage of being sucked into believing their interests lie with rich whites when it doesn't. At least the exploited masses of non-whites know who their enemy is.

"Wheeler and Bailey go to vastly different cafeterias.

Jules bailey worships at the same denomination as Falwell/Huckabee/Franklin Graham/Ted Cruz.  His church preaches female submission and that gays are sinful.  He titthes to this church and also does Bible study with them.Even if his conservative fundy evangelical church pretends to be cool- they are the same homophobes as you would find at Liberty University.   
Wheeler goes to a more inclusive church, and his sky god is not as scary.

Wheeler and Bailey have some similar policies, but I find Bailey untrustworthy & wishy-washy.  Note that he won't defend the church but still gives it $.  What does Bailey believe and what will he stand up for?  Why does he listen to a Pastor who preaches that Jessica Bailey should submit to Jules Bailey?

"At least some of the segregation you are worried about, is by choice.  There are several organizations that will not accept a white member.   Do you also call them racist?  If not, you should.   There are also a number of instances where the issue of race is exaggerated.   Some people seem to think everything is about race when it has nothing to do with race.   Instead of looking at the color of a persons skin, we should be looking at the background and trying to understanding them.  

Also, is that ""peer-reviewed"" research done by people that are trying to prove your views.

# Thematic Analysis

    The critique highlights the tension between supporting religious freedom and upholding human rights. 
    While religious freedom is a fundamental right, it shouldn't override basic human rights and dignity. 
    The author argues that some practices, under the guise of religious freedom, are oppressive and shouldn't be protected. 
    This raises broader questions about the limits of religious tolerance and the balance between respecting diverse cultures 
    and upholding universal human rights. Progressive Democrats' selective support underscores the need for consistency and 
    the protection of human rights over selective religious support.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. (You are rationalizing warnings about anti-gay and female submission) and Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid (that is pretty much your modus operandi).",Confirmation Bias in Group Dynamics,Defensive Conformity,Groupthink as Collective Confirmation Bias,"1.

"My Chickasaw mother was 2nd youngest of 12 children. I had Uncles old enough to be great grandfather. I had 3rd cousins older than my parents. Point being, this family was humongous until Huntington's disease killed 3/4 of my family in a 12 year span.
 Every last one of my Aunts, Uncles, and cousins who had a work ethic rose from third world poverty to middle class, and some to upper middle class. The only ones that did not were either disabled, mentally ill, or took after my grandfather.
 When I went out in the real world I learned my family is not unique and mirrors society. Having lived amongst these people I know all too well their dysfunctional nature, and the nature of their dysfunction. 
 My family threw the bums out so they could not inflict their dysfunction on the family.
It's is long overdue society does the same.
 For the record, I did not dehumanize anyone. These vagrant social parasites dehumanized themselves.","Survival and displacement of dysfunctional family members in a large, achieving family impacted by Huntington's disease",Survival of the Responsible,Family Expulsion of Dysfunction and Societal Critique,"1. **Dysfunctional Segregation**

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

I won't vote any member of Imago Dei.  Do you really think Pastor McKinley is going to change his conservative Baptist ways and reject female submission and embrace equality of gays and heteros?

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike)
and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.  I think the world would be a better place if Imago Dei shrinks because their doctrine is unacceptable.

For example, you could see human beings as opposed to a mess, unsanitary crap.  The failure to see each other as humans beings and the notion that the ""right"" of one person to not being subjected to seeing what they deem an ""eyesore"" superseding human life in and of itself is a fascinating thing.  It's why people protest suicide barriers on bridges, even though we know they save lives, people get upset about their scenic view being disturbed, it's why people cry for ""men's rights"" as a retort to the notion that a woman's body is her own - because they don't even want to acknowledge that women are equal, it's why people complain that they're tired of hearing about racism without thinking how it must feel to live with it everyday.",Valuing Scenic View over Human Life,Dehumanization vs. Empathy,Prioritizing Aesthetic Comfort Over Human Dignity,"1.

"The mentally ill are not getting the treatment they need because of our courts, as other threads have thoroughly addressed. The developmentally disabled have plenty of programs, and readily can get on disability subsidy. The physically disabled are royally screwed by the federal government that will not honor the SSI insurance we forced to pay for to the point to attain disability assistance you have to prove there is not one part time job in America you can work. vets with PTSD...from my experience, 50% if not more have other issues and use this as an excuse. The ones that do are getting help through programs. the VA is who created the problem by not honoring the law just like the fed is doing with the physically disabled.

"you know as much as anybody what a complex issue this is.   with mental illness, which is a big contributor to homelessness, being a lifetime issue dealt with lots of meds if it's serious, and judging by some of the behavior of some of the street people. !?!  treatment is good - the question of how are they going to access the meds?  even with a counselor - they are short-term people (re: blankets, sleeping bags just dumped wherever, easy come, easy go)  and psych meds aren't the most popular  for compliancy with any group.
 then there are just misfits - and the bad kind who are basically uncaring predators of the other street people.

"My point was that as much as you dismiss Springsteen, or think that you should be able to give him input on his songwriting to have his songs better represent fast food workers, a tiny drop of piss dribbled out of him this morning that's more credible than you in the music industry. He was considered a talented up and coming artist in the early 1970's, he's made top ten records that covered un-coverable independent bands, he wrote for Patti Smith when you were in diapers. 

Have some goddamn respect. 

The reason you look like such a childish person right now is that you are trying to hand-wave away Springsteen's 40 year career as a well-respected, credible, honest, and down to Earth musician, and the only reasons you've given amount to ""he's white, he's got a bunch of money, he doesn't write song about Subway, and he wears jeans"".

"There is a sickness among liberals. This is their only way to answer politically different ideas: You're a racist and a bigot. Well, Barack Obama was down in Cuba and carefully choreographed a photo in front of a huge mural of Castro thug Chez Guevara. This murderer was responsible for killing thousands in Cuba and setting up the gulag of political prisons there. Guevara was a well known racist, despising black and indigenous Cubans. Yet there is smiling biracial Barack in front of a guy who called himself ""Stalin II."" To all Liberals: enough of the ""You're a bigot if you support Trump"" garbage. Trump wants to enforce federal immigration laws - something Bush and Obama have not down. The left, pushed by racist groups like La Raza, howl that he and his voters are racist. That's about it. The left is devoid of any intellectual ability. They must cry they are ""triggered"" on campuses by ""Trump 2016"" chalkings and and post drivel like the above.","```plaintext

And many of them were whites since white inmates still make up the majority of the prison population. It just isn't about the natives as Mr. Wohlforth like you to think.

There were plenty of witnesses when Ms. Ellis ran over Mr. Dusenbury, and most of them were white folks. Why did DA Campion dismissed them?

Debathification was stupid, and arrogant.  They left stock piles of bombs around Bagdad that slowly dissolved to become IEDs.

That is false. The fact is domestic violence can and does happen within all couples, and DV between straight couples is reported on  nearly daily in the RG. It is reported on with no one labeling the event as ""a straight people lifestyle that leads to violence.""

"Oh, Lord...Do any of these protestors perchance have slaveholders in their ancestry?  If any of them are white, there's a good chance they do.  So maybe white protestors can be assumed to have had something to do with slavery--kind of like how it's being assumed the restaurant owner has a deep involvement in some really-really historic colonialism.  I think we should ban those proxy slave owners from--from--well, whatever they need banning from on the off chance GGG-Grandpa held slaves.  Or how about this--since British colonialism in India seems to have struck a chord, is there any chance these folks are storing away some energy for protesting India's home-grown caste system--which still exists, by the way?  Say, here's a thought: I'm sure there's at least one Indian restaurant in Portland.  How about picketing them for the caste system?  Oh, wait--they may not be white.

"Mr. Wohlforth's commentary appears to suggest that Alaska Natives are nothing but poor innocent victims of a racist justice system. His tone is extremely patronizing and I wonder if he is playing the ""white man's burden"" role here.  This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations.

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law.

"The Catholic Church has never needed permission to pick and choose for whom it would perform any ceremony.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

Hearing him talk to one of his many nannies who took his daughters to the beach with a bunch of friends and asking repeatedly if they were being touchy feely and flirty is creepy! He kept encouraging the nanny to give them alone time to play. Seriously?!?!  Snitz is single for a reason. If you date him, you date his friends too.

"This is 100 percent baloney. People used to homestead in Alaska till around 1973. Many of the old-timers in Palmer got their land with the mineral rights to the land. That is why we have gravel mined in the valley. The Alaska natives have mineral rights to their land. The Alaska native veterans can still homestead. But not the non-native veteran.

"Have you heard the nasty hate the Bernie supporters throw around. Who in their right mind think dressing up as the KKK is a message of peace. Who the hell runs around call people racist and Nazi thinks that is a message of love. The left is the side of hate. Trump speaks of hope and strength.

How is a student club that supports the Republican front runner close to a active hate group? Trump is only candidate that treats women as individuals and not place the label of victim hood on them. Trump ""famous"" woman must be punished for abortions was a response to what if abortion were already illegal. If you break the law you should be punished ,(side note on the nonsense that pro life don't want to punish women for abortions is crap, A Tennessean woman is on trial for attempted manslaughter for a failed illegal abortion(bathroom abortion not at a clinic)).

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  

It's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.

They would say that Black people in the south were perfectly happy being treated barely better than slaves and who were the civil rights workers to come down there and rile them up with ideas that they were equal with whites and entitled to vote and an education and things like that?

"As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender.
Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex.

"You call me a dummy while cowering behind a fake name and spouting your special vision of some post-apocalyptic hell. A man discharging a gun on my property is a much greater threat than a dog. I most definitely have the right to defend myself against a man on my property with a gun, especially a man shooting at or toward my property.

I find the case of a FedEx driver to be a particularly ironic example of your cowardice distorting your perceptions. FedEx drivers do in fact get charged by dogs every day. Despite this problem, they do not carry guns. They carry DOG BISCUITS!","```python

"A ""history of violence"" you say. That sounds bad! But if you look closer a dog is classified as level-1-aggressive if somebody filed a complaint saying they felt ""threatened"", which can mean anything -- including being barked at. It is not a level-2 or level-3, which are dogs who have actually bit somebody. So you are stretching things quite a bit by saying this dog has a ""history of violence"". Source: http://www.muni.org/Departments/health/Admin/animal_control/Documents/Codified%20Title%2017%20(54%20page%20PDF).pdf

If this dog were such a beast, then why are his neighbors not saying ""good riddance"", or ""serves him right""? No, they are defending the dog owner because they know this dog was harmless and shooting him was a ridiculous over-reaction by a trigger happy idiot.

And to answer your question I would not shoot any dog charging at me. They always stop and turn away.

The people of Portland need to ask themselves why Nigel Jaquiss is so incredibly secretive about his own life.

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.",Code: Radical personal transformation and accountability as a solution to gun violence.,Literal Interpretation of Punitive Justice,**Code: Religious Extremism in Modern Solutions**,"1.

"What a D-Bag review.  But it's typical in a city that is terminally ill with a perpetual case of hipster malaise.  Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.  Eddie Vedder joined them onstage and they looked like teenagers up there just enjoying being a part of our night.

"Drake is 60 years old and has never served in any sort of civic capacity, much less held any position in government, let alone been a Springfield city councilor.   A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"Immersion schools are far from immune to racism. I think Mr. Cramer said the Third World War exercise was the extreme example, but overall he suggested that everyday racist logic and assumptions on the part of white people were more common and therefore the more problematic. 
Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism. Or better yet, they could simply teach kids about the history of white racism in the United States starting in fourth or fifth grade and throughout high school.",Educating against Eurocentric racism in immersion schools and curriculum,Racism Awareness through Education,Education as a Tool to Address Systemic Racism,"- Education against Racism in Immersive Settings

"What a shameful way to treat this man. And what a waste of a man's great capabilities. All because some bigot named Boyko found personal pleasure in attacking this good person. I don't know how Boyko can even look at his own face in a mirror. The reflection of a heinous monster staring back at him should be enough to cause him to change his ugly soul. But apparently it isn't. But you know, for every ugly person out there like Boyko, there's more of us who aren't like him. I support my LGBT community members and will always stand up and vote to protect them from unfair practices. It's taking a long time to get where we need to be, but it WILL eventually happen. People are starting to see the light. And one thing we can count on is that eventually all the old bastards that are currently being jerks will die off. And maybe that will make room for more people who can actually affect change. Good luck to Judge Carlson and his husband. I just hope the best comes their way. Don't lose hope.","```python

We've erased the ancient line that was drawn between right and wrong in regards to marriage, and put ourselves on a terrible trajectory.  I don't believe most advocates of homosexual marriage intend or see the path they've put us on. But the sky's the limit now; the wall has been torn down. Eventually marriage between adults and children (already okay in some backwards portions of the world) will be acceptable in our society, as well as between children and other children. Finally it will be marriage with animals. I mean, why not? Love is love, right?","```plaintext

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

You accuse religious folks of 'superstition' while clinging to your own wishful thinking.","```plaintext

I'm with you----going to bars is a waste of time and money.  Many good people have left a bar only to kill someone from behind the wheel.   Alcohol causes more deaths of innocent people then any other substance .  Given all the damage alcohol was done it's sad we still celebrate making it legal .  Thankfully smoking cigarettes is in decline .   We shouldn't be jumping for joy over legalizing pot . Two wrongs don't a make a right.  In Alaska we need fewer people screwed up--not more.

"Sanders risks looking like a sore loser with this whole superdelegate conversion thing.  And whining about the party registration rules.

Concerned, involved citizens deserve this position, and they are there to do what's best for the party and avoid demagogues.

Most of you people have no clue what goes on in these camps. You all holler lack of housing. Well most campers if you talk to them are heroin addicts. You never see any kids or families. Most I have asked are not even from oregon they came here for the camping. Some are sex offenders and some just out of prison.. So housing will not help them they do not want to work and have a stable life. Many guys said they are travelers they go city to city. So before people keep hollering housing take a tour of the camps. In my visits I did not meet one vet which was great news.

"My comment about Minnery was flagged by you and removed. It had no profanity and wasn't nasty. Just theology. 
I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash. 
Then there is the issue of shell fish. Minnery surely has eaten crab.

     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.  It's not just cakes:  Sooner or later it'll be vital services, other religions, and deja-vu all over again",Conflation of service provision with endorsement of personal beliefs used as a tool for religious-driven social transformation,Commercial Service vs. Personal Belief,**Code:** Service Neutrality vs. Religious Trojan Horse,Commercial Service Separation from Personal Beliefs,"- Commercial Service Separation from Personal Beliefs

"If a gay person is traveling and a hotel or B&B refuses to accommodate them, it's harmful discrimination.   It can kill.  If a doctor refuses care because you are gay causes real harm.   An exterminator who allows a gay couple to live in filth but not a straight couple is discriminating.  When you open a business, you agree to follow the rule not to discriminate.

""Refusing to associate"" is different from discriminating.  Religious people don't have the right to use their religion as an excuse to harm others who only want to do business with them.  Making a cake is a baker's job.  Marching in a pride parade or having a beer with someone is ""associating"".

"It seems that discrimination is only okay if someone is gay, according to Minnery.  And that's because it's a ""choice"".   Who cares if it is?  Who are they hurting if it is a choice?  The ones I know all say they didn't choose to be gay, and most of them (and their families) knew they were gay or trans before puberty.    The ""gay repair therapy"" was proven useless long ago and one of them even admitted they were a bunch of frauds.  How can someone persecute a small child for something they have no control over?

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters. I left Anchorage primarily because of the fact that it was hard to get decent (or any) medical care for seniors. The other reason I left was the barbaric treatment of LGBT by the State of Alaska, law enforcement, and the whole GOPtp roster of hateful, pandering political office holders. There are the so-called religious ""leaders"" some of whom believe LGBT should be murdered.","Systemic homophobia and violence in 1950s-70s Anchorage, with ongoing discrimination and hate by conservatives and religious leaders towards LGBT community.",Systemic Homophobia,Systemic Oppression and Discrimination Against LGBT Community,**Institutionalized Homophobia: Systemic Oppression and Discrimination of the LGBT Community**,**Qualitative Code: Institutional Homophobia and Systemic Discrimination**,Systemic Homophobia and Institutionalized Discrimination Against the LGBT Community,"Institutionalized Homophobia: Violence, Job Discrimination, and Political Influence Against the LGBT Community","- Systemic Homophobia

"Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cake was clear -- he would bake birthday cakes, cookies, whatever else for ANYONE, but he would not participate in sexual immorality by baking a same-sex wedding cake. Why is it that you folks seem unable to see the distinction here?

A birthday cake or a batch of cookies is not the same as a commitment to a lifestyle of sin ... which is what a same-sex wedding cake symbolizes. As long as gays leave me out of their practice of sin, I am not entitled to discriminate. But when they ask/demand that I participate ... then I have a right to an opinion and the religious obligation to say ""no"".","```plaintext

"Sorry, but anyone who believes that Saudi Arabia's ultra-reactionary philosophy of bigotry and hatred of other religions ( including other sects of Islam )  is anything new is either blatantly lying, or is insane.

So OK, if he is not lying, then I guess that we can say that the poor man is delusional, and is mentally ill.

I've posted clear facts showing that other members of the press ( and even his own newspaper, the New York Times ), have known about this for a very long time.    This is not a new development.  Not by any means.   To state otherwise, as he has done here in this editorial, is to spread FALSEHOODS.

"I've just been made aware that the suspects, caught with a vehicle full of $3200 (per owner) worth of goods stolen in a local break-in, just got off with just about no penalties at all. This is part of a family with multiple convictions over the generations. However, the impounded vehicle (with the stolen goods inside) was released from impound to someone using a false address. The owner will never see his stuff again. The break-in artists are free to steal again. Now we neighbors are concerned that the brave person who followed and reported these professional thieves will be subject to retaliation. This is just a microcosm of the Mat-Su and Alaska justice system...mirrors the murder situation in this article. The reasons for not fully prosecuting miscreants is: Lenient (""too compassionate"") District Attorneys; easy judges; and, the kicker: not enough room in our prisons.

"So by your argument people convicted should just give up on life, because nobody wants somebody who made a mistake in life? Pretty harsh, with that argument we should just kill everyone ever convicted of a crime because they have no future and it's just wasting time and resources to keep people with no future in jail or out on the streets.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.

  and then I realize  - he feeds off that energy...it is fuel to his vile rants..it is an excuse to insult any sub-group of our citizenry that aren't rich old greedy white men like him. to his supporters, he's already demonstrated his dislike for at least 50% of his supporters.. these tough poor working women who support him...if he is willing to slur ver accomplished women, how do you think he's gonna regard you?  unless you're eastern European and about 20 yrs old...won't be pretty.
 so I decided the best thing I can do is not go, not feed his rhetoric, not give him a target to rant at, not let him rile the people.  what if nobody went to protest?  would that not take the wind out of his sails?  what would he say?  I think he relishes this stop.",Avoid engaging/feeding Trump's rhetoric,Non-Engagement as Resistance,Defiance and Strategic Abstention as Resistance,From Defiance to Strategic Resistance: Abstention,"- Avoid engaging/feeding Trump's rhetoric

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

"a 45-year-old male student, who dresses as a woman and goes by the name Colleen Francis, undressed and exposed his genitals on several occasions inside the woman’s locker room at Evergreen State College.

Students from nearby Olympia High School as well as children at a local swimming club share locker rooms with the college.

According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.

The coach later apologized when she discovered the man was transgendered but explained there were girls using the facility as young as six years old who weren’t used to seeing male genitals.",The qualitative code for this comment could be: Distress and confusion in shared spaces due to exposure by transgender individuals.,Boundary Transgression,Gender Identity and Locker Room Safety,Gender Identity and Shared Space Safety (w/ Minors),"- Boundary Transgression

"OK, if Americans believe the country is on the wrong track then why did they turn Congress over to a Republican Just Say No, do nothing Congress?  American voters don't know what they want.  President Bill Clinton gave the nation a national budget surplus during his eight-year term.  What happened next?  The Republicans racked up the first $7 trillion in debt and still counting.  China and Japan will own America if they don't already, and Trump's worried more about Mexicans crossing the border?  We heard and witnessed the same campaign slogan from billionaire Ross Perot and look what happened to him.  Trump may have made it pass the Republican primaries, but I don't believe he'll make it pass the general election.

"Yale is private, the U of O is not.
Slavery isn't just some long past forgotten event. It lasted for hundreds of years; today, African-Americans still feel they are second-class citizens. Imagine how you, if you're a white person reading this, would feel about attending a school where a building was named in honor of a white person that had owned and mistreated one of your ancestors. Time to forgive AND forget?
I'd argue, ""Hell, no!""
Either one has the capacity to see another's point of view or one doesn't. It simply is unacceptable to continue to praise these men by leaving the buildings' names in place. They've had their day in the sun, it's time to retire them to the shade.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

""George,

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.

"More bluster about what people think Trump will do.   He won't do anything if he doesn't at least gain the support of this own party, let alone find cooperation from Democrats.    Trump sells an brand in his professional work.  It's really quite a smart, maybe brilliant way to make money and enrich himself.    The man knows what it takes to sell a product and it has little to do with job competence.

I trust nothing about Trump as far as what he might do in a position of public leadership.   Trump isn't special, he's a carnival barker that is selling the public a hazy dream of what's inside the tent.  We don't know what it is, but it's Huge, Special, Exciting, Fantastic.

3. Incompetent Salesman-Leader","1. **Common themes**: All three codes capture the essence of Trump being a skilled salesperson, but lacking in leadership competence and authenticity. The themes of deception, salesmanship, and ineffective leadership are prevalent across the codes.

2. **Similarities and differences**:
   - LLM-1's Trump as a Carnival Barker and LLM-2's Cynical Politician as Salesman share similarities in highlighting Trump's salesmanship and cynicism.
   - LLM-3's Ineffective Leadership and Deceptive Branding is more comprehensive, covering both leadership ineffectiveness and deceptive branding.

3. **Refinements**:
   - To build upon LLM-1's suggestion, I propose refining the codes to: Deceptive Leader, Salesman in Disguise, and Inauthentic Promiser.
   - These codes aim to capture the essence of Trump's leadership style, emphasizing deception, salesmanship, and inauthenticity.

4. **Consolidation**:
   - After reviewing the refined codes, I suggest consolidating them into a single, concise code that captures the user's critique.

"No, you misunderstand, Larry. I'm not suggesting that we need efforts to compensate for past injustices -- I'm suggesting that we need efforts to correct for CURRENT injustices. Voting rights are still being denied based on spurious suggestions of voter fraud (which is virtually non-existent, except in the fevered minds of Republican operatives). Some Republicans have even been courageous (or stupid) enough as to admit that their efforts to restrict voting -- which disproportionately affect (otherwise legitimate) Democratic voters -- are intended to help Republicans win elections. Similarly, it's obvious that there is widespread discrimination against black Americans in policing and other areas.

"If any billionaire did me a favor, which is statistically improbable, they would at least do it using their own money. Democrats prefer to do favors using taxpayer's money, but only when it benefits them in getting votes.

Actually, my son was offered a favor from a billionaire once in the form of a job when he gets out of the military. As it so happens, they were seated next to each other on an airplane flight, in coach. The guy didn't believe in owning a private airplane or flying first class. My son checked this guy out later, and he was legitimate.

"This is not a story about fear. it's about irrational fear coupled with ignorance. 

Your profiling of Guido (and previously expressed distrust of all Muslims) is a perfect example and illustrates the fact that the part of the brain that creates fear is more active in conservative brains. ""In a study published in January, a team led by psychologist Michael Dodd and political scientist John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln found that when viewing a collage of photographs, conservatives' eyes unconsciously lingered 15 percent longer on repellent images, such as car wrecks and excrement—suggesting that conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats.""

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them. Those places where restrooms are required will provide a few single user unisex restrooms, resulting in long lines, or restrooms will be pay-to-play like Europe.

Parental Accountability Limits: Unpredictability of Outcomes & Societal Considerations

**Definition:**

This code reflects the idea that parents should not be held responsible for their adult children's actions, especially in severe cases like murder, once their children are adults and no longer under their direct control. It considers the inherent unpredictability of parenting outcomes and the societal implications of holding parents accountable for their children's actions beyond a certain point.

**Key Points:**

1. **Age Threshold:** Typically, once children reach 18 years old, they are considered adults and are responsible for their own actions.
2. **Diminishing Parental Influence:** As children become independent, parental influence over their decisions and actions decreases.
3. **Societal Implications:** Holding parents accountable for their adult children's actions could lead to broader societal issues, such as legal challenges or financial burdens on families.
4. **Exceptions:** There may be cases where parents are aware of their children's intentions and fail to act, potentially warranting some level of accountability.
5. **Quantitative Data & Cross-Cultural Insights:** Examining statistics and cultural perspectives can provide a more comprehensive understanding of parental accountability limits.","Parents should not be held responsible for their children's actions, especially in serious cases like murder, once their children are adults and no longer under their control.",The qualitative code extracted from the response is: Limits of Parental Accountability & Societal Implications.,Parental Accountability Limits: Unpredictability of Parenting Outcomes & Societal Implications
"So given this subject is about sex consider this:  which bath/lockeroom would or should gays be ""allowed"" in; i.e. this is the mirror opposite in that a heterosexual child would be more shy if those attracted to he/she are in the same room.  In other words, if you're attracted to the same sex you appear to be should you not have to bunk and p with the same?  I would suggest that this rubber room the slippery slope has led us be at least reserved for adults, much like voting, military service and the criminal justice system.  Why make a big deal about kids' sexuality at ages that should only be concerned with practical knowledge of the risks of teen pregnancy, disease and such, especially in the education system?  Where does this silliness stop, when we have Uncle Sam blackmailing us into funding transexual athletics in the interest of fairness?

"You seem to be saying something along the line of ""boys will be boys"", and that not all women are offended by Trump's actions.  And to make it worse, you throw out the red herrings of transgender bathrooms and people's personal liberty as if that personally has an effect on your life.
Then you throw out a bare straw man argument about Bill Clinton and infidelity.  
Mr. Trump is on his 3rd marriage, of which he proudly admits he cheated on his now wives and with other mistresses.  He makes tasteless sexual remarks about his own daughters.  He shows no respect to the women in his life that he should show ultimate respect to.

Mrs. Clinton made her decision regarding her marriage infidelity and for whatever reason chose to keep her marriage intact.  The Clinton's raised a daughter who is a college graduate and a successful working woman.

"I don't think she can  afford to play nice.  That's a mistake many liberals make, assuming others will naturally agree with them.   'If we treat them kindly, they will love us and be transformed'.  Not in a 60 minute debate, not with Donald Trump.

Trump needs to be humiliated and if Hillary is wanting to stand as equal with world leaders, she better show some punch.      I can think of dozens of ways to humiliate Trump and show him as ignorant on important topics — truth has power.   Public humiliation does a lot to take the bully out of circulation.  

The question for a significant number of American's is: can Hillary Clinton  be a leader among men? (foreign and domestic).  Cleary many Americans like an 'alpha dog' style of leadership.    Very few people feel Clinton is entittled to anything... she has to fight.

"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation. The brazen attitudes will increase exponentially as the administration enables their behavior.

"Perhaps Robert should look at it from our point of view. As Americans, we are tired of the degradation of our country. Democrats are no longer democrats, but disguised communists. They no longer represent hard working Americans. They pander to who will vote for them- welfare royalty and the ""Gimme Free!"" crowd.  FDR started and LBJ continued this trend of stealing from the ""rich"" (anybody that works) and giving it to those that don't.  We are currently at the balance of 60% who work, 40% sucking on the public tit.  Republicans are not any different. The ""hands across the aisle"" is code for ""shhh.. we're with you"". Republicans pick the most worthless candidate and expect their members to vote for them.

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

_He calls Hillary Clinton a *****.""_ -- From prior post, after it was edited.

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.

"""I am not saying that transgender people are predators. Not by a long shot. What I am saying is that there are countless deviant men in this world who will pretend to be transgender as a means of gaining access to the people they want to exploit, namely women and children."" 

""There’s no way to make everyone happy in the situation of transgender locker room use. So the priority ought to be finding a way to keep everyone safe.

"I suspect someone who is 80 and Black might ask, ""comes to America""? Or someone who lived in Vietnam during the war years and saw hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens killed by American bombs might ask, ""comes to America""?

Kagan is writing to those who have profited from American international fascism, and who profited from the exporting of jobs that has now terrified the Republican base.
I am reading of the formation of America through the thoughts and actions of Madison and Jefferson, and am a little surprised how much they would agree with Kagan, that the elite just has to be protected against the masses. Madison especially was adamant that power be kept from the poor.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.

"Might I ask for supporting facts on the number of evil white pimps as opposed to the number of kind Black pimps and drug pushers?

You are correct, some original colonies and colonists were sent west with grants and titles.   Such as the original Jamestown but just in case you missed it, there was a thing called the revolution where ties with England were severed so I am not sure what 'land grants' you are referring to.  

Yes, a part of this Nation's history contains slaves.  Some of them from Africa where African people captured other African people and sold them to White people.  Yes there are many people today with poor living conditions, education etc which tend to segregate into public housing, living on taxpayer money, single parents, gangs, violence, drugs, riots, and violence.  Many are of African descent.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman. I would like to hear from girls dressing as boys and see if they feel equal amongst the boys.

"""a surge that coincided with the election of the first black U.S. president""

Unless the author is accusing these people of racist behavior, why is this statement in the article? The author could have easily used Barack Obama's name instead of his preferred racial identity.

""...Jerad and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian and also died in a Las Vegas shooting rampage.""

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

It appears these people are sensible, support the Constitution and family values, and have the widely held sense to distrust the government as did our founders.

"DC,

Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!  No tar and feathering, no running out on a rail, no lynchings (though I think I do vaguely remember reading about the possibility of a mock lynching).

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

Remember, this is the word of God.

I could go on and explain that too but …you know, fruitless. You and the Juneau Empire publisher should get together ‘cause you’re like two peas in quite a limited pod. Same lack of comprehension beyond anything complex.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

"Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…). 
With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a ""black is beautiful"" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.

"Transgender is such a small segment of the population but somehow has commanded and demanded that the majority bow to their demands. I don't want to share a restroom with someone of a different gender, doesn't matter if the person identifies with my gender or not. It's not about being 'transgender'. You were born with certain parts. That's just how it is. If you want to get a sex change operation, then fine. Once changed, you are then that other sex and you should then use that restroom because you then have those parts. That's why men's restrooms have urinals, and women's don't. It's about the parts. 

But if you want to act like a woman (or man) but not change your parts, well, you're still a woman (or man). That's just reality. And no matter which sex you identify with, your parts are still those parts. Your needs are no more important than mine. Why should a majority of people be forced to follow what a minority wants?

"""no matter what is put in front of you regarding crimes committed against trans people you will attempt to minimize it away""

I'm not trying to minimize anything -- I'm trying to promote accuracy.

""The 21 trans people murdered in 2015 listed in the HRC report were recorded as single or multiple bias murders by the FBI.""

Your source? The HRC report makes it clear that they don't know the motive in most of these cases, and complains that too few cases are reported as ""bias-motivated"" crime.

""As far as the man killed in Vermont just a few days ago authorities have yet to determine if his transgender status was a factor. They haven’t expressly said anything except that they were still investigating.""

Actually, as the article I posted said:

""Police initially investigated whether the murder was related to Beede's gender identity.

"There you go, stay the course. It is your hatred/machismo combination that gained you a following by others who hate and appreciate you talking tough and hateful.

The issue here is the whole world is disturbed by Trump's hatred, forget about what the GOP thinks- they have never been concerned what Americans actually think. In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump. The GOP card has been about hate long before Trump- how about: women can't control their own womb, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more coroporation rights than individual rights, problems with what room you go to the bathroom in, who you marry. The racism and hate has always been not far from the GOP, mimicking the traditionally racist south on voting lines. Also no coincidence, it is the vastly undereducated that support the GOP...anyone with an education can see nothing but hate/corporate profiteering and little else.

"This is one of those topics no one wants to touch.

And if you flat out support it, well what about the other shoe: ""both Mike and Jill were drunk.  Mike and Jill had sex.  Jill was drunk: so Mike sexually assaulted her.""  Well...Mike was drunk also...so couldn't it be that Jill assaulted him??  Why is it only one way.

I've personally seen on the UAF campus a woman claim she was raped after she had sex with a male.  Multiple times even.  But the male student wasn't interested in dating, and after she realized this she was overheard saying she was ""raped"" for their sexual encounters.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.
Don't think O'Connor doesn't assume (just like you) the wise old man and wise old woman are white.

"Class? Republicans are not a ""class"" properly speaking but rather members of the Republican party or voters who vote Republican. Just as Democrats are not socio-economically homogenous, neither are Republicans.
As for shame, reasonable people don't expect cretins to have any which is why Mr. Bahr's letter is so perplexing. I suspect he doesn't have a sense of humor since Trump is obviously supremely ludicrous if in a ""sick humor"" sort of way. Let's face it, he makes all Americans look pretty stupid. But he really is a perfect fit for the Republican party, a sort of culmination of sorts of their years of smoking political crack. 
Are Republicans scary? Obviously.  White ghouls always are but instead of them getting a rope and wildly looking for a black man any black man, they're coalescing around a guy that's going to drive their party into the ground.

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case.

"You sir/madam, are as misinformed and delusional as the bastard that committed this horrendous act.

It is not the tool that commits acts such as this, but the individual committing them!

Explosive vests are illegal, but he could have just as easily worn one of those and walked into this club and blown himself up, killing and injuring just as many, if not more, innocent victims.

The tools used to commit this horrendous act are not, and should not be the issue.

The ideology of the murderer very much is, whether it be as an radical Islamic believer or supporter, or a radical homophobic. 

Either way, this horrendous act killed and injured over a hundred innocent individuals simply out to have a good time!

This animal would have found a way to kill and maim because of his mind set, regardless of the tools he utilized to do so.","Radicalized individual responsible for mass violence, not tools.","Blame the Ideology, Not the Tool",Ideology Over Instrument,"Focus on Ideology, Not Tools","- Ideology Drives Violence

"Of course it is about religion, and no matter what you or others say people thankfully still believe their ""lying eyes."" Your trying to excuse it away as nothing more than individual acts of insanity or violence is naive, and will, in the end, cost many lives.

"How ironic that most liberals and gay rights people who support Muslim refugees, support people who stand so strongly against homosexuality. While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)???

As an agnostic, I think all these religions are merely another tool for egotistical  people to exercise power over those who they convince that their 'religion' has some validity.

I don't think you really have the same view of Islam that I learned from practicing Muslims from both Sunni and Shi'a backgrounds.  They believe.  Islam is the Submission to Allah!

Should we go along with the NRA's victories to keep us from being protected from lunatics acquiring guns, domestic violence criminals from getting AK-47s, or children under five picking up guns and killing their siblings or friends?

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

We'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.  A felon, who sold his office to Big Oil.

Thankfully McGuire is finished as a legislator and will not be coming back.","```plaintext

"Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"".  So the most intolerant and easily influenced followers of Islam feel that they have a duty to make that happen.  And the others ... are not sure.  
Of course the Bible has a similar verse, but the New Testament then has a better message to love your neighbor and to love God.  And that helps considerably, for most people.

So you are blaming  ""old white guys"" for the fact that a gay nightclub was not protected by TSA employees? Deborah, it must be nice to live in your little black and white bubble world where if it just wasn't for ""old white men"" the world would be a peaceful, and equitable place.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings. Sexual assault is a horrendous crime against any human, however it is my opinion the term Rape Culture is nonsense and the statement the absence of a no is not consent is just feminist garbage. If you want people to listen to you lose the silly slogans. The problems we are dealing with in our society are breakdown of families, lack of respect for others, lack of self respect and there are too many kids in college that should be digging ditches or learning a trade.  Society has glamorized the beer guzzling and hook ups. Women will be women and men will be men, or whatever you decide to identify as on any given day of the week. I am identifying as a panda bear today.

"Reading the article gave me hope for an even handed portrayal of the reactions to this horrific event. It started out in just that way, then veered into a subtle and not so subtle jab at those who are conservative/republican.
In a number of articles about the shooting and reaction to it, many comment about the hate that seems to be on display about all manner of aspects to the reaction to the shooting. 
There is one aspect to the hate that is being displayed that is not addressed. There is the hate for gays mentioned, hate for Muslims mentioned, hate for different races mentioned, etc. The one hate on prominent display but not mentioned is the hate for anyone or anything conservative. Why does the left hate the right so badly?

"How many NRA guys have done any of these shootings over the years? Answer is NONE. The only people shooting things up are Liberals, and Islamists. Virtually every, single, time.  This guy wasn't a ""nut"" as you like and your ilk repeatedly try to label him. He was a full-blown, Islamist Jihadi, raided in a radicalized family that was allowed to immigrate into the US in 2003. So what Frank? What's your story on the Jihadis who set off those pressure cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon? What, you're going after Martha Stewart or Chef Ramsey now? Fact is this guy was on the FBIs watch list, he associated with guys that went over to fight for ISIS.

"So, by that token you have studied history and are fully aware of the terror, torture, empire building, murders, and subjugation that the christians have wrought on the world as well. Weren't the crusades nothing more than the christians engaging in the same type of activities on muslims for centuries. 

Really seems like about the only good that comes out of religion is a reason to fight someone else because their beliefs are different. And it cuts both ways. My religion is the only one that is valid in my eyes, as yours is the only one that is valid in your eyes, as Islam is the only one that is valid in the muslim's eye. 

Throw into the mix the complete muck-up the US has made of the middle east since the 60's when we armed so many of our now attackers trying to fight the scourge of communism.

What we need is a plan of action to deal with the mentally ill because the current approach is simply not working.  You seem to think that all we need to do is give them medication, home and a job. That is naïve at best, stupid at worst.  Mental health is a life time illness so we need a long term plan. And yes, hospitalization must be part of the plan. I dare any mental health clinian out there who claims that he can come up with a medication in a 15 minutes session. It usually requires weeks to come up with what works for just one patient. Helping a human being like this requires a full court press.....not the care bear approach that you like,. Anything else, is a waste of money and that is the hard cold truth.  Another Reader.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again. And they will.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community? 

 If religious bias leads to charity, empathy, compassion, I'm OK.  If religious bias is toward killing non believers, I have a problem

I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders. 

Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shoot, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his rump.’

And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fricking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’

"Labels are a problem if the object of the label exhibits some qualities that match the label but at other times does not. Trump certainly has a cadre of women who seem to at least accept his statements about women. Is he just kindof sexist? Maybe
Regardless of labels,I don't want a president that exhibits such unbridled use of language. Our leaders present examples to our citizens, especially our children. There are things Trump has said that can't be mentioned in high school classrooms.

"I wonder why so many liberals parents taught them to use name calling as a way to make themselves seem larger or their point stronger.   I don't mind that people disagree with me .  I just laugh at the way their brains are so small they think name calling makes them appear larger than they really are.

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives.

Another shooting, by a muslim declaring terrorist associations.  Blame the gun.
Another theft, burglary, robbery, murder, etc.  Blame drugs, blame society, blame anything except the person who commits the crime!

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"I don't recall the author or myself insinuating that any rape or even unsolicited ""petting"", etc. is justifiable - his advice was to fight back.  You are either misstating what was written, or missed the point entirely. The point the author is making is that people need to be holding themselves more accountable for the situations they enter into and making better decisions in life in general. His point is that times have and are changing, and that the ""liberation"" movement for women simultaneously freed men from social accountability and responsibility ( and in some way purpose), and that negative societal and social consequences have resulted. Yes, kids do foolish things, but the only way to know it is foolish is to have something bad happen to you, learn from someone else's mistakes, or take good counsel.

"A new definition of irony, hypocrisy, hidden agenda resulting in total lack of credibility and revealing a cluelessness rarely seen at the executive level:

This muslim radical terrorist ""self identifies"" on facebook, phone calls, texting etc as such and tbe Administration / AG now redact and inexplicably try to dilute the hard facts-just like Beghazi et al.  Fact.  

The same Admin wants transgender rights for those that ""self identify"" as another sex and decry those questioning the slippery slope as bigots.  Fact.  

So what's in a phrase?  Hmm.  

The gay community is admirably and  understandably proactive in defending themselves-much like Israel on the world stage.  And owning a gun (or mace, taser, etc) is the best way to assuage the helplessness and mitigate a nightmare scenario that arrises from such tragic events.

The ONLY reason you people believe is because you are absolutely clueless as to what it is you even worship.

Try watching ""A history of God"" and educate yourself. It's a strictly neutral documentary from the BBC. I'd suggest watching it with a google window open on a handy device to fact check as you watch. 

I am 100% certain though every single one of you bible thumpers don't bother to even watch 5 minutes. Too much at stake if I am right and you are wrong huh?

"First, there can be no comparison between sexual assault and someone getting rolled at a party. None. That being said...

Just so I’m clear, if you’re incapacitated you deserve, on some level, to be robbed “or worse”. You’ve gone to this party, where I’m guessing you were among people you knew and trusted, got wasted, and we’re insert crime here, and it’s your fault.

This has nothing going to do with a “culture of victimhood,” whatever that means, and everything to do with the attempt to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim. The fact is, he’s wrong, as are you. Women, regardless of how their dressed, what they’ve drank, who they’ve previously had relations with, what part of town they happen to be in, or any other qualifier that used to be, and sadly still is, used, are never responsible for the crimes committed against them.

"Evangelicals ""panting desire for affirmation""---oh, Donny, oh, yes, yes, arrest those women ""bleeding out of their whatever""--which Trump is all too delighted to quench--does originate in their feelings of inferiority, feelings that have been successfully exploited for decades. Evangelicals are stuck in a vicious cycle because they long ago sold their souls to Baal and so are insatiable in their desire to dominate and debase the biblically stigmatized.  
As Gerson points out, evangelicals have a well-documented history of eagerly offering their specialized services to the Republican party. They are its 'fille-de-joie'--not very bright but suitable for gratification of Trump's inordinate political lust hence his special attention to them at this juncture.

"Thank you Elizabeth for your well written letter.  I blame our regulators.  The AMA approved the sale.  Shame on them.  Shame on Trillium.  Unfortunately, no amount of disgust, sorrow and frustration will change anything.  I posted yesterday my doctors name and her husband.  They've got their million.  I love my doctor and I'm sorry I failed in my now deleted post to express that.  I'd been w/Dr Mary Pugsley for many years and she always, always made me feel like she really cared.  She listened.  She ordered tests when I needed them.  Never hesitated.

It still stands true however, that beginning 3 years ago, she changed.  The 'fake' physicals where we just chatted.  The concern I had over some new strange symptoms that scared me.  She said ""huh, that's not normal"" and then sent me on my way w/no information.  She'd changed.  
I'm a good person.  I felt dismissed.  Now?  Learning all of this?  I'm ashamed.  Of her, I feel stupid now thinking it was my fault.

"What lies did Clinton tell about the attack?  Are you referring to the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" being blamed?  Are you aware that no less authority on the attacks than Ahmed Abu Khattala, the leader of Ansar al-Shariah (the group that carried out the attack) has stated that the attack was in retaliation for the film?  That embassies in Yemen, Pakistan, Egypt and Tunisia were also attacked in response to the film?  The main difference between Benghazi and the other attacks is that the other attacks were all on hardened, purpose built facilities, while the Benghazi attack was on a non-hardened, leased, temporary facility.  The deaths in Benghazi had nothing to do with Clinton, but rather with the office of Diplomatic Security failing to properly harden the building (and with congress failing to provide funding so that they could).","Inadequate security preparation and response, unrelated to Clinton's statements.","Exonerating Clinton, Blaming Circumstance",Clinton's Benghazi Deception,"Misplaced Blame on Film, Inadequate Security

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

"No, not everyone is Portland is racist, but Portland has a long history of racist actions, including wiping out entire black neighborhoods for coliseums and hospitals, and then bitching when a home on a single lot is turned into multiple dwellings.

So, essentially, you despise mainstream black culture because of ""macho posturing, opportunism and predation, and violence including its lesser forms (e.g. coercion, peer pressure etc.)"" and assume that every black person is automatically that way?

Would it be fair to say you hate black culture (because of someone else bullying you) even though you've never personally been affected by it?

And because of that, you assume it's black people's fault they can't get along in white-dominated towns?

"Waldman is right--and being politically very naive.  While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.

Never heard of Claremont McKenna College but it's not a place I'd send my kids to after this.

Trump isn't Hitler.  Nor is he simply 'non-PC'.  Nor is he merely an ""amateur"".  No, he's woefully ignorant of how our constitutional republic is set up to operate.  He engages his mouth without engaging his brain.  He panders to whatever audience he's talking to.  His personal morals and ethics are bankrupt.  He's dishonest.

I'm sure your right about some teachers, plumbers, clergy, etc., that stereotype and say silly things like 'all white people are racists' while there are just as many saying the same things about any other color or ethnicity. It's true that some will use it as cover to point a finger while engaging in their own bigotry saying 'well, at least I'm not as bad as x'.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

Some people simply want to hurt, and destroy, and kill, and will convince themselves of whatever they need in order to feel justified.

However there's no way you're going to convince me that shooting a bunch of random family men in the back is any way forwards.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it. But as I noted above, Financial Facts I pulled up just using the back of an envelope and 30 minutes show 1 Billion + in savings can be had without touching the PFD, without any new taxes, and without even touching SB21 or the Oil tax Credits. I could do a lot better with a copy of the actual budget in hand. How is it a lower-class, uneducated mutt like myself can find over a billion in savings when our high-class, 70k + per year salaried Oilies in the Legislature can only find the Permanent Fund to Raid?

If the Legislature REALLY wants the people behind it, they need to process all the savings I noted, restructure SB21, and *eliminate*, not DEFER, most of the Tax Credits. Then people will start getting behind more ideas on raising revenues.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else? 

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else?

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

People should wake up and realize ALL lives matter regardless of skin color.","Perception of BLM as selectively addressing Black lives loss, promoting racism, and undermining the principle of equal value for all lives.",BLM Skepticism,Questioning BLM's Authenticity and Advocacy for Equality,Skepticism of BLM's Focus and Promotion of Racism,Skepticism of BLM's Focus and Intentions,**Refined Code:** Skepticism of BLM's Selective Focus and Advocacy for Equality,"Skepticism of BLM's Focus, Promotion of Racism, and Advocacy for Equality","Skepticism of BLM's Intentions, Perceptions of Racism, and Advocacy for Universal Equality",Skepticism of BLM's Focus and Advocacy for Equality,Questioning BLM's Focus and Perceived Racism Promotion,"1. **LLM-1's initial code**: Perception of BLM as selectively addressing Black lives loss, promoting racism, and undermining the principle of equal value for all lives.

"""Of course all lives should matter and the point made by BLM is that they should matter too, not more"".   Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM. What red, yellow, white and brown skinned people hear clearly...is that Black Lives Matter more and are therefore more valued. So how do you explain BLM to the Korean Americans angered by police killing of a young male.  La Habra police were too quick to shoot in New Year's Eve incident, critics say. A young man killed for alledged vandalism with a tire iron but no weapon. A young man of YELLOW skinned pigmentation. Isn't it less damning to say ALL Lives matter and not single out  Blacks. Imagine if you will, what the parents of this deceased young man are feeling every time they see and hear BLM..., he was not black but didn't his life matter?

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
He later recounted ""I was relieved to see a white man."" 

And from where does such an ingrained response stem from? 
A history of a much higher crime rate among African-Americans.
