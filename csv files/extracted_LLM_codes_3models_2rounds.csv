"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

These ASI people are the biggest hypocrites. 

The fact is that ASI has the fewest minorities and poor families of all the Spanish immersion programs in Portland, by far.

ASI has become a place for rich white kids to learn Spanish while also using public funding. 

ASI have orchestrated a campaign to show how they are being ""segregated"". They've brought in ringers, had people put on fake accents, every disingenuous argument that they could come up with, all so that the program does not have to move to another building less than 3 miles away.
Moving the program would open it up to more poor families of color, but ASI  would rather abandon the program than allow this.

One more big difference.... the left publicized  the name and address of the Ferguson cop,  but not so with the Malheur cop.  Why?

Some of these people will use legal means for the take back of power, while others will necessarily fight violence with violence. It will take both approaches to obtain results.
The Malheur occupation was a situation of rich ranchers exploiting the ignorance of poorer white people to legitimate the privatization of public lands, one of the aims of the super rich. The Malheur occupation didn't succeed. Poor white people have the disadvantage of being sucked into believing their interests lie with rich whites when it doesn't.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

"Hmm- did you read my post? I said that your position on gays is, technically speaking, bigotry.

There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and
wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.

The failure to see each other as humans beings and the notion that the ""right"" of one person to not being subjected to seeing what they deem an ""eyesore"" superseding human life in and of itself is a fascinating thing.

**Refined Coding System for Dehumanization and Moral Prioritization**

1. **Definition:**
   - **Dehumanization:** Treating individuals as less than human by ignoring their inherent value or dignity.
   - **Moral Prioritization:** Prioritizing personal, aesthetic, or other values over human life or well-being.

2. **Contextual Flexibility:**
   - The code should be applicable across various contexts, such as urban planning, social media, and social justice issues.
   - Examples include prioritizing scenic views over homelessness or dismissing perspectives based on social media aesthetics.

3. **Inter-LLM Consistency:**
   - Establish a shared glossary of terms and provide examples for consistent application across different AI models.

4. **Sub-Codes:**
   - Consider sub-codes for specific contexts, such as Aesthetic Prioritization or Economic Prioritization, to allow for more detailed analysis.

5. **Balancing Precision and Clarity:**
   - Ensure the code is precise for academic research while maintaining clarity for a general audience.
   - Consider separating the code into distinct concepts if they often occur together.

6. **Incorporating Related Issues:**
   - Ensure flexibility to incorporate related issues like systemic racism or gender-based discrimination without becoming too vague.

By implementing these refinements, the coding system will be more robust, adaptable, and effective in capturing the nuances of dehumanization and moral prioritization across various contexts.

You simply cannot successfully wage war against largely urban terrorists using conventional warfare. It is a dirty, house-by-house effort that always (see Israel in Lebanon) is highly lethal to those on the attacking side. It always is to be avoided.
By seeking to kill and capture the leaders, we are doing what is the most intelligent and mature response possible: it is highly effective, but it takes a little time.

And many of them were whites since white inmates still make up the majority of the prison population. It just isn't about the natives as Mr. Wohlforth like you to think. Question should be, why are some witnesses, regardless of their ethnic background, disbelieved? This isn't just a native problem, its may be a problem for all ethnic backgrounds. There were plenty of witnesses when Ms. Ellis ran over Mr. Dusenbury, and most of them were white folks. Why did DA Campion dismissed them?

They miss their responsibility for creating the conditions that make for a rich soup of angry people who don't see any way out.  Of course we all know that the Iraqi war was the worst response, particular how the first six months were handled. Bush's team was arrogant. Blackwater was arrogant.  Debathification was stupid, and arrogant.  They left stock piles of bombs around Bagdad that slowly dissolved to become IEDs. And throughout this the words of support for Islam were undermined by the radical right.

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot.

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

"Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.

Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.

And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.

I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.

Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA.

"Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.

Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.

This code captures the main themes present in the comment. It highlights the misinterpretation of cultural practices, specifically the speaker's dance traditions, and the marginalization resulting from the misuse of terms related to their culture. The speaker feels frustrated by the incorrect assumptions about their dances and the derogatory use of terms like Chickasaw red, which fosters shame and undermines cultural pride. This code also emphasizes the power dynamics and cultural insensitivity that contribute to the perceived double standards in labeling and using racial references.",Cultural Insensitivity and Terminological Marginalization (CITM),**Cultural Misrepresentation and Marginalization**,Cultural Misinterpretation and Terminological Marginalization (CMTM),"**Cultural Insensitivity and Terminological Marginalization (CITM)**

2. **Terminological Marginalization**: The harmful effects of using certain terms, such as red as a slur, which fosters shame and undermines cultural pride, leading to marginalization and the erosion of cultural traditions.

* **Cultural Pride vs. Appropriation**: Captures the tension between cultural pride and appropriation but may not fully address the issue of terminological marginalization.

"Having used 'gender neutral' bathrooms in Korea clear back in 1988 as well as seeing the local citizenry relieve themselves in little open-air port-a-potties next to the rice paddies, as well as in the center of village streets out in the country, I am not too concerned about who or what gender use bathroom facilities for that purpose.   Sort of like the open-air urinals they have in France.  

In this country, however, the reason a person is in a bathroom which does not match their biological equipment is a much different situation just because our society is different.  Expecting the vast majority in our society to encourage transgender bathroom visits is just plain silly.  

It's no really different than getting an American to accept women's topless swimming which is common in Europe and in resorts frequented by many Europeans.

So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female.

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.

Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.  The Bible says it's an abomination for a man to lay with another man in the way of a woman.  There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash.

     1. Over 50% of Christians, and the vast majority of younger Christians, don't share your belief that providing services or selling goods to LGBTs amounts to facilitating sin (don't trust me, google it).  So this can't be The Christian Position.
     2. This argument was widely used by Christians to justify racial discrimination in the not too distant past, and there are undoubtedly some that still believe this.  Do you support legalizing such discrimination because it is based on strongly held religious belief?
     3.  If we protect bakers and florists as you recommend, aren't we also allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone on the same grounds?

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains. Of course conservatives never talk about the men murdered, beaten and harassed for being--or perceived to be--gay in Anchorage back in the day. Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters.

"I would love to see a woman with good judgment replace the incompetent and biased (male) Bill Randall as a Planning Commissioner.

I also don't believe age necessarily results in an ""ossified mind"" or that youth ensures ""original thinking.""

I believe in the value of deliberative groups having members with diverse experiences, but a person should reflect competence and sound judgment that have arisen from his or her experiences.

The bit about riding her bike and being appointed by disliked council members is silly. I've seen Nicollelo up-close and she's simply unqualified and demonstrates seriously poor judgment. Her thinking may be ""original,"" but it isn't sound.

"I am appalled that these people are getting a misdemeanor! These people should be locked up and the key thrown away! Can you imagine working next to the husband or wife and all the while they think this is ok???

These individuals need to be locked up for good. I'm tempted to show up on the 16th just to stare them down. Just think, mothers and fathers, if this really gets a misdemeanor, there is no jail time or very minimal at that. It's a fine (maybe) and a slap on the hand. Nothing under a ""misdemeanor"" has any ability to attempt to correct a mental problem such as this. These people need API and major, major jail time for severe child neglect and abuse.

"“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.

Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.

Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?

Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.

"Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead.

""George,

I was disheartened reading your guest viewpoint in today’s Register Guard.  By most accounts, the city hall process has not gone as hoped for, and I accept responsibility for my part in this process, including not keeping the council consistently up-to-date as possible changes in scope and budget arose.  My intent was to provide council with complete information about a design option that more fully met your adopted values, rather than continually involve you in the iterative process.  In communications prior to and during the recent work session I acknowledged that it was not a good decision, and I offered no excuses to try to justify my decision.  Although the process has been faulty, there has not been a conspiracy, nor secret intent, nor an attempt to “hoodwink” the council.  I believe suggesting otherwise is unwarranted, unfounded and unbelievable, and also disrespects the independence, judgment and discernment of the other council members...""","Accountability for communication lapse, not conspiracy in city hall process",DEFENSIVENESS,**Code:** Accountability and Transparency in Communication,Assuming Responsibility and Clarifying Intentions,Accountability and Intent Clarification,**Code:** Accountability and Transparency in Communication,**Code:** Accountability and Transparency in Communication,"* Accountability, Transparency, and Intent Clarification

"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals.

"I had to move to California for an education that is not available at UAA. No way that I want to go to a college that is building new bullshit buildings and $110 million sports arenas while cutting the only reason we go to school, to get an education! I love the teachers there, but forget paying for some stupid sports and buildings, thinking that this will make people want to move to Alaska for college. Nobody moves to Alaska because one of the pros is that we have a new freaking arena. A great education in my interested field of study is why I would move for school. Not to mention the basketball coach obviously doesn't like black people and everyone knows it. These people who make financial decisions should get schooled by us because this is ridiculous.

"Exposure to nudity of the opposite gender in person for a young person unused to it is quite different than exposure on TV, just as exposure to acts of war in person results in PTSD far more than watching realistic depictions of it on TV does.

The obvious best solution to safety and convenience for all is the traditional way it has always been, but with more awareness and sensitivity by heterosexuals towards the transgendered. No one wants to deny transsexuals a place to relieve themselves, but to accommodate everyone in a safe manner. Any other solution is going to result in social upheaval of longstanding traditions of modesty, and will result in removal of all multiuser public restrooms in any place that does not require them. Those places where restrooms are required will provide a few single user unisex restrooms, resulting in long lines, or restrooms will be pay-to-play like Europe.

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

Yeah, that's a sensible way to manage a comments feature.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

No, the truth is that there is a difference among the candidates, and people whose well-being greatly depends on who's president have paid attention for longer than this election cycle and have voted for Hillary.

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.

"Daniel, thanks for your reply.  I don't believe that the people that disagree with my opinion are ""idiots"" or have ""mental issues"".  I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.

I live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.

I also think that a doctor/pharmacy shouldn't ever be forced to write/fill a prescription they don't feel comfortable with.","Respect for personal choice and autonomy in decision-making, promoting concern for others without coercion, advocating for medical professionals' comfort and discretion in prescription practices.",Autonomy over Intervention,Respecting Individual Autonomy and Choices,"Promoting Personal Autonomy with Empathy and Professional Discretion

You are correct, some original colonies and colonists were sent west with grants and titles.   Such as the original Jamestown but just in case you missed it, there was a thing called the revolution where ties with England were severed so I am not sure what 'land grants' you are referring to.  

Yes, a part of this Nation's history contains slaves.  Some of them from Africa where African people captured other African people and sold them to White people.

"And since we're talking about ""tranny porn"" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.

"Looking for,
Here is the part of the Oregon Encyclopedia you ignored:
Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

"It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.

The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.

And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: ""I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough""

And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam ""a white man's war"", and said that ""My enemy is the white people!""

"Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.

When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:

""There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?""

That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.

In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump.

If you say ""hold on a second, sometimes they are drunk (not passed out), consent and are happy to consent, but afterwards regret it: then they were sexually assaulted""...now you get bashed for ""supporting sexual victimization.""  And if you flat out support it, well what about the other shoe: ""both Mike and Jill were drunk.  Mike and Jill had sex.  Jill was drunk: so Mike sexually assaulted her.""  Well...Mike was drunk also...so couldn't it be that Jill assaulted him??  Why is it only one way.

I've personally seen on the UAF campus a woman claim she was raped after she had sex with a male.  Multiple times even.  But the male student wasn't interested in dating, and after she realized this she was overheard saying she was ""raped"" for their sexual encounters.  How do situations like this play into that ""1 in 9""?

"Alaska being so remote and known as the Last Frontier seems to  receive it’s share of deranged folks who seem to think they can escape their problems from back home.  This is so typical of folks coming up here to  “live out their adventure or dream”  and as it happens  quite often, it becomes a nightmare.  Remember the loners who came up here to places like McCarthy or say Manley Hot Springs. These same minded  like folks then took it to the extreme and ended up murdering scores of innocent people in those communities. Then we have those who kill maybe one or two, all because of being sick minded losers who prey on those who cannot defend themselves. This story ended up on a positive note, lucky for this guy.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'. 
La Raza, baby, indeed. Jose Vasconcelos coined the term, La Raza Cosmica, to express his idea of a fifth ""race"" (a social construct used to designate groups of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics) which in Vasconcelos' essay is an agglomeration of all the ""races"" in the world without respect to color or number who will erect a new kind of civilization called Universópolis. 
His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.
Don't think O'Connor doesn't assume (just like you) the wise old man and wise old woman are white.

You do not do this with other crime.  Do you have a ""statutory assault""....do you have ""date robbery""....do you have ""two college students drunk robbery""?

"The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism.

Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge.

"For some reason these things come down to the ""bad seed"" (""ethical deficit"") argument (don't we all have an ethical deficit?). I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. 
I'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. 
Now, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement ""Mexicans are criminals"".

"Whatever, you hate women and wish them to suffer.  What other conclusion can be reached when you encourage young women to make choices that bring them pain and suffering.   It is you who supports predators by encouraging young women to drink irresponsibly and place themselves in dangerous situations.  Suppose we kill each drunk boy who has sex with a drunk woman.  Let's kill them quickly and summarily.  Do you think that will stop drunk on drunk sex.  Of course not because drinking ain't gonna stop and rational choices ain't gonna be made by those that get drunk.

"WA:The NYT has a well-documented article on Trump in Atlantic City and an editorial by Peter Werner.  Here's a paragraph from the OpEd piece.  Both articles are well worth reading.  ""Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has — among other in-the-gutter moments — implied that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case. This is conspiratorial craziness and rank racism — and all of it has happened after we were told Mr. Trump would raise his game.""",The qualitative code extracted from the response is: Divisive Conspiracy Theories and Racist Attacks.,Trump's Divisive Rhetoric,Divisive Rhetoric,"1.

While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened.

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

"Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"".

"And the deflection begins again!

Another shooting, this time part of the 3.5% of the population was the target.  So the typical outcry is eliminate guns or eliminate discrimination or more hate crimes laws.  When the real ""cause"" had nothing to do with firearms or discrimination.  The base cause is cultural.  The shooter's culture vs American culture.

Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American.  As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home.  Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act.  ISIS announced an attack 3 days before.  Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic.  These are the storyline so far.

He and his Father were known to the FBI and ""on their radar"" but the FBI couldn't tie them to any terror cell.  Just like the Boston bomber and the San Bernardino shooters.  The FBI was useless or complicit.

If this city officially create a homeless camp, it would be a bottomless pit of responsibility and destruction of any sort of financial stability this city ever hope to have.

In fact, many cities are now taking the opposite tack, realizing the compassion, care and support for the homeless, are actually enabling and encouraging the homeless.

That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.  He would be on the hook for child support if a child were produced and he would be the one responsible if she later cried rape.

"The multiple instances of the phrase ""gun violence"" in this editorial is indicative of the failure of the author to understand the cause of the violence being discussed. Guns may be the tool of choice for those doing this kind of violence, but guns are not the cause of it. Studying guns will not stop this violence and will in fact distract us from focusing on the real problem: the people who perpetrate this violence and their motives. Recently, the motives have been crystal clear: furthering the cause of radical Islam through murder and spreading fear. The reason ""nothing changes"" is because the response of our President and the political leftists he leads has been to use these tragedies to further their cause to disarm the American public, leaving us even more vulnerable, rather than vigorously pursuing, capturing or killing those radical Islamists responsible before they do this again.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape.

"This is a most silly statement for you to make about these women, and illustrates blatant sexism & chauvinism on your part.  

The women in these establishments are horribly abused and taken advantage of in numerous ways.  For one, they are generally not even hired as employees of the establishment.  So they get no salary, and no benefits of any kind.  No social security, no disability, no unemployment, NOTHING!

And such establishments are very often dens of drug dealing & prostitution. Club 1444 was infamous for both of those activities. Many of the owners get the poor dancing girls hooked on drugs, so that the ""tips"" that they do earn from customers ends up going back to the club owner drug dealer.  In order to maintain their drug habit, the women often get pushed into prostitution too, in order to earn enough money for their drugs., The women thus then end up horribly abused, exploited, addicted, and diseased, and have nothing at all to show for their ""work""

"Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?

I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless. 

I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.   

In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?

"I wonder why so many liberals parents taught them to use name calling as a way to make themselves seem larger or their point stronger.   I don't mind that people disagree with me .  I just laugh at the way their brains are so small they think name calling makes them appear larger than they really are.  People who have to call others names do so because they don't know how to make their point any other way.   And it's just not me. Look how they called Sullivan names---Danny Boy , Ohio Dan and other names. It backfired.   For reasons only known to them liberals think name calling or intentional mis-spelling a name helps their causes when it doesn't . With the gay rights vote they called everyone bigots and homophobes and worse . They were leading in the polls until the naming calling---and they lost.

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives.

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"All my comments pointed to the benefits of learning how human beings relate to the world, what molds their attitudes and developing true empathy for the downtrodden, low income and low priority.  People raised in poverty and are racially and/or culturally deprived, live in a parallel universe that's ugly, dog-eat-dog and cannot even relate to the demands of the dominant white culture, which the police generally represent.  We, as a society, have to admit and OWN the horrendous dysfunction of our racially and economically stratified culture. Our enforced ""wall-in, wall out"" system has produced the highest incarceration rate of any advanced country on the planet.  And blacks and latinos are far, far over-represented in that population.  It's not because they're evil.  It's because we've discriminated against them, marginalized them, and thrown them into the societal garbage can.  They're not happy and we don't give a damn if they are or not.

Your comment would make a heartfelt eulogy at these women's funerals.

If you have children, have they ever disobeyed you? Did you kill them? That is what Leviticus calls for.
Have you ever eaten pork? Touched a pig or anything made from a pig? Abomination.

"This article finally made me realize white privilege (I'm white). 

Before gentrification really took off, there were a number of efforts to increase cultural diversity and help the poor minority neighborhoods. I started seeing a new class of ""hip"" kids appearing. They never thought about local issues, and would visibly sneer at those of us that weren't rich and didn't move here (because only the stupid or lazy stay home).

Now the locals are on the verge of homelessness (and there's more homeless than ever), while there's a new class of rich white folk complaining about being discriminated against because people aren't always as nice to them as they feel that they deserve. The cultural diversity programs have faded away and been replaced by all sorts of stuff catering to rich white people -- who tend to look down on the less affluent.

While Trump is truly an original in American politics (outside lunatic fringe candidates), this isn't the first time that the Republican party has nominated someone so odious that a significant part of the party's leadership defected to the Democrat candidate.

In 1884, the Republicans, against expectations, nominated James G. Blaine, senator from Maine.  Blaine, unlike Trump, had a long career in public service.  But his name had repeatedly been tainted with financial scandal.  Many party leaders (""Mugwumps)"" refused to support Blaine on moral grounds.  The Democrats nominated the reformer Grover Cleveland.  The campaign was emotional and ugly on both sides.  Cleveland barely won the popular vote in New York state, and hence the presidency.

Morris sent a letter to Indiana lawmakers saying he was planning to withdraw his daughters from the Girl Scouts, alleging that they “are a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood, encourage sex and allow transgender females to join.”",The qualitative code for the comment could be: Political grandstanding and Spreading false rumors.,Misogynistic Politicization,Unfounded Accusations,**Misogynistic Baseless Political Attack**,"- Misogynistic Politicization

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it.

"As a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, I can tell you that it changed my life. I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past.

"But Jen, it was these acts of police brutality that brought about the attack on the Dallas PD Thurs night.  The sniper Micah Johnson made that most clear in his phone calls with the Dallas Police.  He was very upset about these killings.  He targeted killing white police officers as an act of revenge.

So if you are against the shootings of the Dallas Officers, how can you not also be against these cases of police brutality, which helped to precipitate this horrible attack on the police?  Why weren't you out there joining in this protest at the U of O?   Do you not care if black people are murdered by the police??

You should also be angry with the National Rifle Association for their part in making the attack on the Dallas Police force possible.

BLM say that they are non violent and just want to have an honest dialogue and get the problems out in the open so that they can be solved.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
