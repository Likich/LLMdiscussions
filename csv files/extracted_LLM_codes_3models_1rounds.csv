The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza. 

Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

"You mistake confirmation bias among a ""natural group""
for group think.

Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of conservatives versus liberals,[4] or the solitary nature of introverts.[5] However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and thus is perhaps better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group.

Here is a group think definition that should trouble Imago Dei members:Type II: Closed-mindedness

"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

It's amazing how arrogant business owners like Sally and Nick are to think that Portland has enough racists or racist-sympathizers to keep their restaurants afloat.",Business owner insensitivity to racial justice issues and potential negative impact on business reputation,Accountability Over Profit,Ethical Business Practices,Committed Ethical Business Practices,Refined Code: Committed Social Responsibility,Ethical Accountability for Social Justice,Prioritizing Racial Justice for Ethical Reputation,Committed Ethical Business Practices,Committed Ethical and Social Responsibility

"The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both ""allies"" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.

On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.

It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  

There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.

Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love.
Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade?

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.","Jesus' teachings as a radical solution to gun violence, with potential consequences and personal impact.",Literal Interpretation of Non-Compromising Faith,Extreme Religious Principles as a Solution to Social Problems,"Advocacy for Applying Extreme Biblical Principles as a Radical Solution to Social Problems, with Personal Impact and Potential Consequences",Advocating Radical Biblical Solutions to Gun Violence: Personal and Societal Implications,Extreme Religious Principles as a Solution to Social Problems,Advocating Radical Biblical Solutions to Social Problems: Personal and Societal Implications,Advocating Radical Biblical Solutions to Gun Violence: Personal and Societal Implications,Advocating Radical Biblical Solutions to Gun Violence: Personal and Societal Implications

Only in Portland would a soulful, sincere and genuine rocker like Bruce get the ""what have you done for us lately"" treatment.  The band is tight and the energy they provided is a much-needed reminder of how it's done.  The River, for those who get it, is an album that covers a lot of ground: from teenage missteps, to fear and doubt, all the way to plain old ""fuck you, it's Friday"" rock n roll.  I've seen the man a dozen times (most recently the Seattle show right after the Portland show) and he killed it.  The energy from the crowd was off the charts despite a muddy sound system and he put on one of his finest shows: non-stop, joyful, deep and of course, moving.

A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?

The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.

"Thomas Morse:  It's not always nature that people have different needs for like sexual partners.  Sometimes it can be nurture, possibly from a parent or people that has power over a child and abuses this kid.  The Bible says it's an abomination for a man to lay with another man in the way of a woman.  There are some other references in the Bible that I don't believe they are being interpreted correctly by believers.  As far as I know, there aren't any references to the Bible that it's an abomination for a person to have dark skin or to be fat, ugly or to be physically handicapped.  Your argument doesn't hold water.  I believe that a Christian has a right to follow their religion.  If they don't want to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple then they shouldn't have to.

"If you would predicate your arguments on biology learn something of it.  ""Homosexuality"" among vertebrates which reproduce as we do seldom occurs in nature, except in severely stressed and/or captive populations, or 'symbolically' as expressions of dominance.

Among animals with alternate reproductive strategies 'homosexuality' simply doesn't apply.  Fish called wrasses (family Labridae) start out life and reproduce as females but later transform into and reproduce as males.  This transformation is no different than what occurs in most vertebrate embryos, except that in most species the transformation takes place in-utero and before onset of sexual function.

Earthworms, snails and an odd little fish called a 'hamlet' (Hypoplectrus spp.) have both sets of genitalia and gametes, and take turns fertilizing each others' when mating.  It's not 'homosexuality', and it's 'normal' for those species.

I pointed out that Minnery's wife works - contrary to Biblical law. A woman's place is as a help mate to her husband - keep the home and bear children. 
I referenced a popular ""clobber"" verse that Christians use and I wrote that the same Bible book has more to say. For instance, a woman who is menstruating isn't permitted to sleep inside the home. I am certain that Mrs. Minnery sleeps in her bedroom when she has her period. 
Then there is the matter of their children. The clobber verses come from Leviticus which is clear about what to do with disobedient children - kill them. 
The suit Minnery is wearing in the photo is quite nice. If it's made with mixed fibers then he is to be punished with the lash.

"I think the first confusion here lies in equating baking a wedding cake for a same sex couple with doing something immoral.  Even if you believe homosexual acts are wrong, even if you believe same-sex marriage is wrong, baking a cake for a homosexual couple is not immoral, even a wedding cake:  It's just baking a cake.  If you're already in the business of making wedding cakes, it's what you do.  You're not approving of any particular marriage, or sanctifying it---You're just providing a service.  

I believe the error arises because of people like Minnery, who want to make a case for asserting religious beliefs in the public sphere, and that the issue of ""religious freedom"" itself is a trojan horse for political and social transformation in the name of religion.  It's not just cakes:  Sooner or later it'll be vital services, other religions, and deja-vu all over again","Use of baking cake as a symbol for providing neutral, secular services; opposition to religious freedom being used as a justification for political and social transformation.",Commercial vs. Convictional Service,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement,Equating Service Provision with Moral Endorsement
"If a gay person is traveling and a hotel or B&B refuses to accommodate them, it's harmful discrimination.   It can kill.  If a doctor refuses care because you are gay causes real harm.   An exterminator who allows a gay couple to live in filth but not a straight couple is discriminating.  When you open a business, you agree to follow the rule not to discriminate.

""Refusing to associate"" is different from discriminating.  Religious people don't have the right to use their religion as an excuse to harm others who only want to do business with them.  Making a cake is a baker's job.  Marching in a pride parade or having a beer with someone is ""associating"".

"A) they didn't say they were too busy, they said they could bake the cake until they found out the couple was gay. They chose to openly discriminate, which was stupid and illegal, and they got what they deserved. However, if they HAD said they were too busy, but they only said that to the gays, that would also be illegal and they would get what they deserve for violating the law. This is super easy to understand, all the way around. 

B) if they only tell gay people they can't have figurines, that is discriminatory and illegal. They should tell EVERYONE they can't have figurines, then they'd be OK. But that's not what they did, so they got what they deserved.

Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way?

"Sorry, Bob, Hillory the Blood Countess PROMISED to ""obliterate"" (her word) the Islamic Republic of Iran--that's 70 million human beings--with tactical nuclear weapons at an appearance before a Dartmouth University crowd just last year (07/03/15).

"_""Seems Mr. Welch has his a few problems with civil discourse._

This is too ludicrous. Apparently someone behind the scenes replaced the five-letter ""W"" word I used, which is an exact synonym for ""prostitute,"" which is what JoshuaWelch called Hillary Clinton.  

So, let's see. If I call someone a ""prostitute,"" who is obviously not a prostitute (as Welch did), that is ""civil.""

But if some responds to me that I should not refer to a woman as a [the ""W"" word here], _that person_ is uncivil.

"Fascinating....to see a Washington Post contributor deride a Republican. Yet it's 'OK' for the major US newspapers to now criticize Trump, now that he has the nomination. Before this point, and playing a major role in his rise to the nomination (besides all the other candidates being downright terrifying), the major newspapers have treated us all to a 'reality newspaper', instead of reality television, where Mr. Trump was, without any kind of judgement  for national security threatening campaign remarks (like the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper bag), painted in a light of idolization for his off the cuff remarks and high ratings envisioned soundbites. Yet if you're still holding your Trump card as a good thing, and that no talent a-clown gets elected, you are why America is going down in a ball of WWIII flames in a few years.

Look, I have no problem with anyone because they're a fan of Bernie or a critic of Hillary. I do have a real problem with smug,  self-absorbed ""I won't vote"" Bernie supporters who could lead to a Trump presidency.

Here's a little clue -- it's unfortunately true that black citizens are still, on average, less well-off than whites. Differences between who may be president really matter to them. And who do they overwhelmingly support? Hillary Clinton.
 
OK ... I dare someone to say that's because Hillary is playing them for a fool, and they're too unintelligent to realize it.

"I witnessed two rapes in broad daylight. Both times I called the cops. Both times it was an inebriated man accosting an inebriated woman, both times in the thick bushes. I asked the cops if perhaps they could patrol the area and arrest the drunks before things got out of hand. They said there was no law to arrest loiterers & public drinking. And they seemed to say there's nothing they could do because they'd keep doing it, so why bother. 

The sad part was that the rapist was the same person. The DA didn't prosecute because the victim wouldn't testify. The rapist went on to kill someone. 

Anchorage first needs to change loitering laws. Then it needs to change laws regarding public inebriation. Then it needs to get a police department who wants to actually do community policing and enforcement and mayor's office that will back it all up. I'm glad i moved away.

(And by the way, for those geographically ignorant Americans --- which is most of them --- who for whatever PC reason prefer the word ""Asian"" to ""Oriental"", let me point out that the continent of Asia consists of MANY more lands, and more peoples, than simply those of the Orient.)

"It’s been my consistent observation that “animal welfare” activists are overwhelmingly comprised of emotionally stunted, over-privileged white people who lack empathy for their fellow human beings — particularly those with whom they don’t socially, culturally or visually identify — to the point where they value other species as more noble, worthy and beautiful than their own.

Such pathetic “‘people” don’t hesitate to argue that killing an animal is just as bad as killing a human. And all but the most extreme of them refuse to admit the other, and unavoidable, side of their argument — that in their eyes killing human beings (except for themselves) is no worse than, or not as bad as, killing an animal.  That's the way the Nazis thought.  That's the way the da'esh (""ISIS"") thinks now.

And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist.
Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips.

Black Exclusion Laws in Oregon-
Opening sentence: 
""Oregon's racial makeup has been shaped by three black exclusion laws that were in place during much of the region's early history. These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white"".

At the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon 
 in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]

"So you are simply addicted to alcohol so much, that you cannot resist occasionally drinking and then driving?

Are you not aware of what the Holy Bible says about drinking alcohol?   Just in the book of Proverbs alone, it is condemned many times.  Do you not know that Satan has a special section of Hell organized for those who drink and do drugs?

Proverbs 20:1  Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls. Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.

Proverbs 21:17  Those who love pleasure become poor; those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.

Proverbs 23:31-33   Do not look on the wine when it is red.  At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper.  Your eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things.

So if  you continue to drink you will become stupid, and get into fights.  You will also always be poor, and perversions will come out of your mouth.

"Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.

The issue here is the whole world is disturbed by Trump's hatred, forget about what the GOP thinks- they have never been concerned what Americans actually think. In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump. The GOP card has been about hate long before Trump- how about: women can't control their own womb, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more coroporation rights than individual rights, problems with what room you go to the bathroom in, who you marry. The racism and hate has always been not far from the GOP, mimicking the traditionally racist south on voting lines. Also no coincidence, it is the vastly undereducated that support the GOP...anyone with an education can see nothing but hate/corporate profiteering and little else.

"You misconstrue the meaning of 'la raza' to simplistically mean 'race' which in a general sense it means 'the people'.

His ideal is one to which we can aspire while recognizing that racism--a race-based worldview with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination of non-whites, remains an ingrained aspect of American socio-economic and political institutions.

"Could there be a worse advocate of raiding the Permanent Fund earnings than McGuire?  NO!  Not too many years ago McGuire was thrown off an Alaska Airlines flight for her deranged behavior.

Recall that McGuire spent $40,000 last year on travel, to places like Paris.  And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.

McGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.

Corporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.

"Rivers, bad idea because if Anchorage create a homeless camp, then Anchorage will be responsible for all the things that goes on in that homeless camp. If this city officially create a homeless camp, it would be a bottomless pit of responsibility and destruction of any sort of financial stability this city ever hope to have. That is why, most cities never adopt such an approach. Cost over run will bankrupt any city. Even places like Honolulu who got homeless problems that utterly dwarf Anchorage's, wasn't that stupid to create a homeless camp.....cost and responsibility simply will be too high. In fact, many cities are now taking the opposite tack, realizing the compassion, care and support for the homeless, are actually enabling and encouraging the homeless. We should also understand that many of the homeless who are mentally ill....often choose NOT to take their medication during the period when they are totally lucid, able and high functioning.

"I taught my boys that they have to do the work for themselves AND the girl.  That they were responsible for the girl, even if she was throwing herself at them (which, sadly happens and happened too much because the girls were not taught how to be ladies) that they had to be a gentlemen on her behalf.  Because if something happened it would be the boy they came after, not the girl.  She would just get away with her provocative behavior and they would hold him responsible.  He would be on the hook for child support if a child were produced and he would be the one responsible if she later cried rape.  Yes, girls and women need to be taught that if you dress like a $2 whore and rub up against a guy and heaven forbid add alcohol to the mix, you are asking for trouble.

"It makes sense  to look at the catalysts that surround sexual assault in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In dissecting the histories of sexual deviants you will find poor or non-existent nuclear families, sexual abuse, physical abuse and in some cases perfect childhoods and upbringings. Sexual assault is a horrendous crime against any human, however it is my opinion the term Rape Culture is nonsense and the statement the absence of a no is not consent is just feminist garbage.

"You should read ""Rape Culture in the Alaska Wilderness."" It appears in The Atlantic. It clearly shows a culture in which rape is accepted and inevitable. If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, ""don't rape.""

The majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole.

"No matter how hard democrats try to use tragedies to push for greater gun control , two facts always stand clear : gun control laws won't stop these mass killings and democrats don't understand this fact.   Everyone knows the real goal of democrats is to get every gun from every American .  They ask who needs an assault rifle ?  How about average American's who are faced with groups of thugs threatening to burn down home's and steal every time a court decision doesn't go their way ?  In Baltimore the pathetic mayor ordered police to stand down and allow thugs to blow off steam by destroying buildings and stealing everything they wanted. If law abiding people there had just one assault rifle per home or business---nothing would have been burned down or stolen or there would have been a hundred fewer thugs the next time the court decision didn't go their way.

1. **Emotionally Dysfunctional with Violent Tendencies**  
   This code encapsulates the individual's emotional instability, use of violent and hateful language, and the potential threat they pose to others.

2. **Violent, Emotionally Unstable, and Gun-Obsessed Individual**  
   This code highlights the individual's violent tendencies, emotional instability, and fixation on guns, which are central themes in the comment.

### Comparison of Refined Codes:
- **LLM-1:** Violent, Unstable Gun Enthusiast  
  - **Strengths:** Directly addresses the violent tendencies and gun fixation.  
  - **Weaknesses:** Lacks emphasis on emotional instability.  

- **LLM-2:** Emotionally Disturbed with Violent History  
  - **Strengths:** Captures emotional instability and violent tendencies.  
  - **Weaknesses:** Does not explicitly mention the gun fixation.  

- **LLM-3:** Emotionally Dysfunctional with Violent Tendencies  
  - **Strengths:** Balances emotional instability, violent tendencies, and implies a potential threat.  
  - **Weaknesses:** Could be more explicit about the gun fixation.  

### Final Recommendation:
The most comprehensive code is **Emotionally Dysfunctional with Violent Tendencies**, as it effectively captures the essence of the comment while maintaining brevity.

"I'm deeply disappointed in Havelock for not evolving in his thinking about sexuality. He writes that ""the fact is that virginity at marriage is uncommon and the argument that pre-marital sex is inappropriate has lost its force."" That cult of virginity was only ever important for women. Men have historically been sanctioned to get experience, categorizing women into two camps--girls you take home to mother and the superfreaks. Additionally, teenage sex was common if you look at the age of marriage. My own great grandmother married at 14, not uncommon in agricultural families of the early century. What has changed is that women are now encouraged to get an education, explore their sexuality, and choose a life mate (if they do) after they are ready, not as a breadwinner but as a companion. 

Perhaps what disappoints me most about the ideas in this article is that it treats rape as a sexual relationship and not the violent act of aggression it is. It's violent assault.

"Unfortunately, money talks and Hobby Lobby has lots of it.

The first thing I thought of when I saw the ad in the RG on Monday from Hobby Lobby was how Hobby Lobby are such hypocrites about their Christianity.  Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.

The best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.",The qualitative code for the comment could be: Hypocrisy in business practices related to religious observance.,Hypocrisy in Christian Values,**Code:** Hypocrisy in Business Practices,"- Hypocrisy in Christian Values

"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum",Escalating Fear and Anger due to Polarization and Violence,Escalating Cycle of Fear and Violence,Cycle of Fear and Distrust Escalating Violence,"1.

"If it's just a marker Mr. Atkinson, I can go along with it.

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

"Black Lives Matter a movement and message damming any chance for diminishing racism. BLM is in all actuality encouraging and promoting racism. All lives matter...no, Black Lives Matter. So it's clear - Black lives matter, red, yellow, brown, white not so much. If that's not a racist and divisive message I can't even imagine a message that is more damning.  If you want to have a constructive conversation to eliminate unneeded tragic deaths then organize all the involved to identify all the elements that present in cases where injury or death occur - be the victims natural pigmentation be yellow, brown, white, red or black. Identify contributing causes and implement plans to correct/eliminate them. This is the work that needs to be taking place...don't waste your time or risk lives with your racist message marches.",Promoting divisive racism,Counter-Narrative to BLM,Perceived Racism in BLM's Message: Advocating for Inclusive Solutions Over Division,Perceived Divisiveness in BLM Message: Advocating for Inclusive Problem-Solving Approach,Perceived Divisiveness in BLM: Inclusive Problem-Solving,**Refined Code:** Perceived Divisiveness of BLM: Advocating for Inclusive Problem-Solving,Perceived Divisiveness in BLM Message: Advocating for Inclusive Problem-Solving Approach,Perceived Divisiveness in BLM Message: Advocating for Inclusive Problem-Solving Approach,Perceived Divisiveness in BLM Message: Advocating for Inclusive Problem-Solving Approach
"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else?

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

People should wake up and realize ALL lives matter regardless of skin color.",The qualitative code extracted from the response is: Black Lives Matter perceived as promoting racism and disregarding Black-on-Black violence.,BLM Skepticism,Questioning BLM's Authenticity and Promoting Racial Division,Skepticism towards BLM's Intentions and Impact,"1.

"""Of course all lives should matter and the point made by BLM is that they should matter too, not more"".   Interesting conclusion you have drawn but BLM doesn't say nor suggest that - it simply says Black LM. What red, yellow, white and brown skinned people hear clearly...is that Black Lives Matter more and are therefore more valued. So how do you explain BLM to the Korean Americans angered by police killing of a young male.  La Habra police were too quick to shoot in New Year's Eve incident, critics say. A young man killed for alledged vandalism with a tire iron but no weapon. A young man of YELLOW skinned pigmentation. Isn't it less damning to say ALL Lives matter and not single out  Blacks. Imagine if you will, what the parents of this deceased young man are feeling every time they see and hear BLM..., he was not black but didn't his life matter? I am trying to imagine you explaining BLM to this young mans family.",Perceived prioritization of Black lives by BLM movement causing division and confusion.,Perceived Exclusivity,**Code:** Perceived Exclusivity of BLM,"- Perceived Exclusivity of BLM

"""Nate"": ""it seems clear that a lot of police treat black people differently than their whiter neighbors."" 
I am afraid this is true...BUT, it is not ""Racism"" in the classical sense.
 
Much research has been done in the reactions of people of different races to photos
of ""criminals""- Black & White; along with 'shooting scenarios'. Such research has shown
a marked difference in the response time to 'shoot', depending on whether the ""criminal'
depicted is white or black.

Even Black Police Officers shot more quickly, with less hesitation, when the 'criminal' 
displayed is Black.
 
Recall Jesse Jackson once stating that he was strolling at night, and heard a noise behind him.
He later recounted ""I was relieved to see a white man."" 

And from where does such an ingrained response stem from? 
A history of a much higher crime rate among African-Americans.
Everyone knows this, even other African-Americans.",Implicit racial bias in police response,Implicit Bias,Ingrained Racial Bias Influenced by Historical Crime Perceptions,Implicit Bias: Ingrained Racial Stereotypes from Crime Statistics in Police Response Influenced by History,"**Qualitative Codes:**
