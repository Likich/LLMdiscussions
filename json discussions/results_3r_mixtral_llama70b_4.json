    "comment": "amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject  covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe.",

These laws, all later rescinded, largely succeeded in their aim of discouraging free blacks from settling in Oregon early on, ensuring that Oregon would develop as primarily white\".\n\nAt the conclusion  of this OE piece the author notes this constitutional clause and other laws were effective  in keeping out blacks-- there were just 128 African-Americans  in Oregon \n in 1860.  [this was 0.24% of the total Oregon population; in 1940, strangely, it was still  0.24%!]  \n\nFrankly, I'm at a complete loss as to why you are so determined to contradict our historians,  the NAACP at  the Mims etc. on this.

So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman.

This refinement adds depth to the code and addresses the resistance to inclusivity and the \"impersonation\" perspective.\n\nAdditionally, the refined codes can be complementary or hierarchical, with \"Gender Essentialism and Inequality in Sports Participation Policies\" serving as the overarching theme and \"Exclusionary Femininity and Territoriality\" providing further specificity on the sentiment expressed in the comment.

It highlights the speaker's opposition to policies that permit transgender individuals to participate in sports according to their gender identity.\n\nLLM-2: Code: \"Exclusionary Femininity and Territoriality\"\n\nThis code captures the speaker's exclusionary attitude towards transgender individuals and their perceived territoriality over traditional notions of femininity. By emphasizing \"Exclusionary Femininity,\" it highlights the speaker's belief that only certain individuals who possess specific characteristics and experiences can be considered genuine women, and those who do not possess these traits are not welcome to participate in activities reserved for women.\n\nIn addition, I propose the following sub-codes to further refine the sentiment expressed in the comment:\n\n* \"Essentialist Beliefs\" - This sub-code highlights the speaker's belief that there are inherent characteristics that define gender and that these traits determine who can legitimately participate in sports.\n* \"Power Dynamics and Resistance\" - This sub-code emphasizes the dynamics of power and domination that underpin the speaker's resistance to inclusivity, highlighting their position of privilege and their reluctance to share it.\n* \"Emotional Underpinnings\" - This sub-code focuses on the emotional elements that drive the speaker's sentiment, such as feelings of protectiveness, territoriality, and a sense of being threatened or \"robbed\" by the idea of males impersonating females.\n* \"Impersonation vs. Self-Identified Gender\" - This sub-code underscores the speaker's distinction between impersonation and self-identified gender, highlighting their belief that the gender identity of transgender individuals is illegitimate.\n\nThese refinements aim to capture the nuances of the sentiment expressed in the comment and allow for a more in-depth analysis of the speaker's attitudes towards gender and sports participation.

Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W\u2026). \nWith the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a \"black is beautiful\" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking.\nYou may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls.

I don't want to share a restroom with someone of a different gender, doesn't matter if the person identifies with my gender or not. It's not about being 'transgender'. You were born with certain parts. That's just how it is. If you want to get a sex change operation, then fine. Once changed, you are then that other sex and you should then use that restroom because you then have those parts. That's why men's restrooms have urinals, and women's don't. It's about the parts. \n\nBut if you want to act like a woman (or man) but not change your parts, well, you're still a woman (or man). That's just reality. And no matter which sex you identify with, your parts are still those parts. Your needs are no more important than mine. Why should a majority of people be forced to follow what a minority wants?

However, the code proposed by LLM-2, \"Biological Essentialism,\" is more concise and captures the underlying philosophy of the comment. Here are some refinements to the code that can be made collaboratively:\n\n1. Expand the Definition: The code can be expanded to include a broader definition of \"Biological Essentialism\" that goes beyond sex and gender. For instance, it can capture the idea that people's identities, abilities, and roles are solely determined by their biological characteristics, and that any deviation from this is unacceptable.\n2. Add a Sub-Code: A sub-code can be added to capture the resistance to accommodating the needs and rights of transgender individuals. For example, \"Opposition to Transgender Accommodation.\" This sub-code would help to further detail the ways in which the commenter expresses their Biological Essentialism.\n3. Clarify the Language: The language used in the code can be made clearer and more concise. For example, instead of \"A focus on physical characteristics as the defining aspect of sex,\" it can be revised to \"Emphasis on Physical Characteristics as Defining Sex.\" This change would make the code easier to understand and apply.\n4. Incorporate Intersectionality: The code can be refined to consider the intersectionality of the commenter's beliefs. For instance, their Biological Essentialism may be influenced by other factors such as race, religion, or socio-economic status.\n\nThese refinements aim to create a more nuanced and comprehensive code that can be used to analyze similar comments. The refined code would look like this:\n\n**\"Biological Essentialism\"**\n\n* Emphasis on Physical Characteristics as Defining Sex\n* Skepticism towards Self-identification and Gender Expression\n* Opposition to Transgender Accommodation\n* Intersectionality (optional)\n\nThis refined code captures the themes of the comment, including the commenter's emphasis on biological characteristics, their skepticism towards self-identification, and their resistance to accommodating transgender individuals' needs and rights.

I was born and Baptized Catholic until I got old enough to know better. In all fairness though, the Catholic  messengers are not the only Religious folks guilty of such atrocities. I guess it just comes with the territory and it has to be handled on an individual level. If you don't like something, then don't participate!",

In fact, it is their blatant disregard for any issues that Americans truly support that helped created the monster that is Trump. The GOP card has been about hate long before Trump- how about: women can't control their own womb, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more coroporation rights than individual rights, problems with what room you go to the bathroom in, who you marry. The racism and hate has always been not far from the GOP, mimicking the traditionally racist south on voting lines.

This is so typical of folks coming up here to  \u201clive out their adventure or dream\u201d  and as it happens  quite often, it becomes a nightmare.  Remember the loners who came up here to places like McCarthy or say Manley Hot Springs. These same minded  like folks then took it to the extreme and ended up murdering scores of innocent people in those communities. Then we have those who kill maybe one or two, all because of being sick minded losers who prey on those who cannot defend themselves. This story ended up on a positive note, lucky for this guy.

But with rape, there is always a way to minimize what happened by putting it in these so called classifications, or as you say \"situations.\"  Or as you have put it so succinctly - rape is \"no big deal\"   Rape is the only thing in the world in which the victim is automatically thought of as \"lying\" - in which there is a never ending supply of excuses blaming the victim and excusing the predator (she was flirting, there was alcohol, she went out by herself etc) - that gets classified for different situations etc.  That's my version of reality, that's the reality the rest of us non-women hating, non-predator advocating people live in.",

I suspect he doesn't have a sense of humor since Trump is obviously supremely ludicrous if in a \"sick humor\" sort of way. Let's face it, he makes all Americans look pretty stupid. But he really is a perfect fit for the Republican party, a sort of culmination of sorts of their years of smoking political crack. \nAre Republicans scary? Obviously.  White ghouls always are but instead of them getting a rope and wildly looking for a black man any black man, they're coalescing around a guy that's going to drive their party into the ground.

I'd argue that Trump is playing on ignorance, feelings of betrayal, and nationalism, but not that his supporters are as a group have an ethical deficit. \nI'd agree the implication is that the vast majority of immigrants (in Trump's statement) are bad people by the way he says some are good. And you are correct:Stats show they commit fewer crimes residents. But I think Dale is hearing that Mexican criminals and illegals (their term) need to be kept out. \nNow, Trump may be insinuating that Mexicans in general are criminals, but an insinuation is more subjective than a direct statement \"Mexicans are criminals\".

He most likely has clients mixed in, none have come forward yet, but there have been some names mentioned where he again, traded \"sex\" to lower their bills.  The two sites that are growing every day from the sheer volume of women posting, are: Liars, Cheaters R Us, and Cheater Report.  Under David Bruce Peters there are over 200 posts, and most of these are legitimate.  Obviously, we all have to shake our heads once again, because the counseling years ago did not take, and he isn't bothering with any at this point in time.  This type of personal life has spilled over to his professional and also, when you look him up by Google, you will find these sites come to the top of the page.\n\nUnfortunately, he is a very sick individual. Not likely the damage control can happen",

While the Christian Bible only have one passage condemning homosexual behavior, Islamic Koran got several paragraphs on the subject and Koran clearly stated the death penalty for gays.  Most Muslims believe that homosexual activity is utterly blasphemous to God and even if they don't say it out loud or claims they deplored what happened.......if they believes in the Koran as deeply as they all claims, they cannot help but to approved of what just happened. And this commentary  shouldn't be considered hateful or nasty. It is the way of life in the world of Islam. How many gay bars do you find in the Middle East (not including Israel)??? How many Muslims are there who claims to be gay?? (zero to none??)",

And that McGuire's staffers spent $500 per night on fancy hotel rooms.\n\nMcGuire voted to give away Alaska's oil with SB-21, (to the tune, currently of about $10 billion per year), and McGuire supports corporate welfare, which if eliminated, would be a greater saving than the Permanent Fund raid she is screwing Alaskans with.\n\nCorporate welfare of $700 million per year to Big Oil is different than funding schools or Troopers.  The difference?  We actually need Troopers, and educated kids.\n\nWe'd expect this sort of betrayal, and rank stupididty, from a woman who was married to a convicted felon.

So what Frank? What's your story on the Jihadis who set off those pressure cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon? What, you're going after Martha Stewart or Chef Ramsey now? Fact is this guy was on the FBIs watch list, he associated with guys that went over to fight for ISIS. His Dad was at least supportive of some Islamist groups abroad and maybe here in the U.S.  Maybe you can explain Islam is in conflict with every culture that it comes into contact with that isn't already Islamic?

Weren't the crusades nothing more than the christians engaging in the same type of activities on muslims for centuries. \n\nReally seems like about the only good that comes out of religion is a reason to fight someone else because their beliefs are different. And it cuts both ways. My religion is the only one that is valid in my eyes, as yours is the only one that is valid in your eyes, as Islam is the only one that is valid in the muslim's eye. \n\nThrow into the mix the complete muck-up the US has made of the middle east since the 60's when we armed so many of our now attackers trying to fight the scourge of communism. We can continue to paint this as an issue of a religion that wants to \"destroy christianity\", but that is akin to trying to describe an elephant to a blind man by describing only the trunk.",

That is na\u00efve at best, stupid at worst.  Mental health is a life time illness so we need a long term plan. And yes, hospitalization must be part of the plan. I dare any mental health clinian out there who claims that he can come up with a medication in a 15 minutes session. It usually requires weeks to come up with what works for just one patient.

If you believe that all of Alaska is the same way, you have issues. The overwhelming majority of men never have and never will rape, molest, or otherwise assault a woman. Now, how is that possible when they were most likely never told, \"don't rape.\"\n\nThe majority of rapists are known to their victims and because so few are reported they are free to rape repeatedly, and even when they are reported, police, university, and judicial bungling limit the percentage of rapists actually incarcerated to a tiny fraction of the whole. If Brock Peters' ridiculous 6-month sentence seems insulting, keep in mind he is one of the very few who will ever go to prison for rape.

But murder *two* dozen women and girls . . . maybe not?  Or is there some sort of 3/5's compromise since they were conveniently brown people overseas?  What's the take away for young girls growing up in America?  Study hard, go to good schools, and maybe you, too, can buttress a shaky political record with the murder of convenient foreigners just like a shoddy male politician.

I didnt know that I needed to sign up under my name or else editors of the paper would call me a coward, I would assume you have better things to do, but ok. I guess im sorry for saying 'I' instead of 'my friend' but there is a character limit. I could give you an inventory of the violence and crime I've seen in E. PDX, but thats not really the point is it? (also, if you find me, you can probably find out why my mom would kill me if i was on 122 that night. I went home, he went to the bus stop. I still have a bit of survivors guilt about that night, all these years later) I got robbed in Eugene once, so does that make me ok now? I saw some americans of mexican descent beat up some white kids when i was 12 in Newberg, but somehow i dont assume that all 'mexicans' like to fight white people, imagine that!",

You will recall Newt Gingrich's \"Contract with America\" and the fact that Republicans obtained a majority in Congress in 1994. Obama is also an economically conservative Democrat and also faced a Republican majority in the House. Progress will be made when the Republican party is fully repudiated and the Democrats take over the political center. The Republican party is showing its true colors in Donald Trump. With the Republicans, you've got a range from \"weapons of mass destruction\" Dick Chaney to \"deport all the Mexicans and Muslims\" Donald Trump and their followers range from misogynist Christians to knuckle dragging white supremacists. Mentally stable Americans really have only once choice--making sure the Democrats win so that the Republicans LOSE.

Adding a phrase that reflects this moral judgment could enhance the code. For example, \"Intense Polarization, Moral Repudiation of Republican Extremism, and Advocacy for Democratic Progress.\"\n\n2. **Emphasize the Speaker's View of Progress**: The speaker's worldview is rooted in the belief that the Democratic Party embodies progress, and the Republican Party hinders it. Emphasizing this aspect could provide a clearer understanding of the speaker's political stance. A possible refinement could be, \"Polarized Vision of Progress: Rejection of Republican Extremism and Advocacy for Democratic Leadership.\"\n\n3. **Simplify While Maintaining Clarity**: Codes should be concise yet informative. Ensuring that the refined code remains easy to understand and apply to similar comments is crucial.

I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color. Using a majority white, relatively crime free population stat to silence the experiences of brown people is a pretty standard way of keeping people of color on the fringes of the reality you and Tyler Hurst live. \n\nLong and short of it, statistically speaking, you were bound to try and deny our experiences as people of color.",

Consider adding a facet to the code that captures this blame attribution, such as \"Socio-Political Narrative of Conspiracy, Blame, and Inaction Related to Violence.\"\n3. **Enhancing specificity**: While the codes have become more comprehensive, they still might benefit from greater specificity. For instance, the code could explicitly mention the role of political correctness, Islamophobia, or xenophobia, if these themes are indeed present in the comment.\n4. **Considering a hierarchical coding structure**: LLM-2 mentioned code hierarchization, which could be useful in capturing the complexities of the comment. A hierarchical structure could comprise:\n\t* A high-level code, such as \"Socio-Political Narrative\"\n\t* Mid-level codes, like \"Conspiracy Theory\" or \"Blame Attribution\"\n\t* Low-level codes, which could include specific aspects like \"Islamophobia\" or \"Political Correctness\"\n5. **Inter-coder reliability and iterative refinement**: Continue refining the codes through iterative collaboration between LLMs, ensuring that the codes accurately reflect the comment's themes and nuances. This process can help identify and address any potential biases or inconsistencies.\n6. **Contextual considerations**: Take into account the broader context in which the comment was made, including the social, political, and cultural environment. This can help inform the coding process and ensure that the codes are relevant and accurate.\n\nBy implementing these refinements, the codes can become even more comprehensive, nuanced, and accurate in capturing the essence of the comment.
